<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> new scientific
method of teaching history requires that the student should learn
to examine some at least of the evidence for himself, and to
form a judgment upon it: he is no longer expected to accept the
teacher&#8217;s statements without discussion. Material for examination
is, however, usually in the inaccessible form of ancient records, Latin
chronicles, and so forth. It is the part of source-books to provide
extracts from such records which may serve as laboratory specimens
for analysis. They have the further aim of painting scenes vivid with
local colour and live with the expressions of the actors themselves, so
making the dry bones of the text-book put on flesh and reality.</p>

<p>This volume contains illustrations of various stages in the
economic and social life of the British people from Saxon days to
the Industrial Revolution. Fragments of the Saxon laws show the
give and take of community life working out into rules of fair play
and justice. The influence of the Church in trade, in education, in
exploration and over-seas intercourse, appears in the life of Ingulf
of Croyland. Town life is seen to develop through gild regulations and
the records of London. The consequent growth of the burghers&#8217;
power in Parliament, in naval organization and in finance over against
the power of great noble houses, and the disorder of the fifteenth
century, emerge from the Paston Correspondence. Parliamentary Rolls,
and the accounts of London&#8217;s growth. From manorial regulations,
notes of wages at different periods, and contemporaries&#8217;
accounts of enclosures, the great changes in rural life are shown;
while the explorations of Carpini and Marco Polo in the East and the
Spaniards&#8217; account of Drake&#8217;s piracy in the West indicate
the change from the medi&aelig;val to the modern world. The growth
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
commerce as the controlling factor in politics is indicated by the
letters of Sir Thomas Roe and the East India Company&#8217;s minutes,
the writings of Defoe and Franklin; and Young&#8217;s tour hints at the
state of England on the eve of the Industrial Revolution.</p>

<p>These extracts have, as far as possible, been taken from sources
which the teacher can easily consult further on particular points,
in the hope of promoting such study, without which the average
teacher&#8217;s fountain of inspiration must soon run dry, to the
withering of his pupil&#8217;s zeal.</p>

<p>For permission to borrow from their volumes I am greatly indebted
to Sir W. Foster and Miss Sainsbury, Mr. S. C. Hill and Mr. Callender,
also to the Hakluyt Society, the Royal Historical Society, the Oxford
University Press, Mr. John Murray, and Messrs. Ginn &amp; Co.</p>

SAXON VILLAGE AND MANORIAL SYSTEMS</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTORY NOTES</h3>

<p class="subhead">Laws of Ethelbert</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">These</span> laws are dated
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 600, only three years after the coming
of St. Augustine. Throughout them and the later dooms the educative
effect of Christianity in its Roman form is to be traced. Hitherto
law had been oral, traditional, unrecorded; these customary laws are
now first reduced to written form and made permanent for the local
kingdom.</p>

<p>(5) Compensation, already reckoned in money though not always paid
in coin (cf. 59), is the customary quittance for every offence.</p>

<p>(9) Crime, hitherto an offence only against the victim and his kin,
is here further treated as an offence against the community represented
by the King.</p>

<p>(74, 77) Status of woman high; marriage a business contract.</p>

<p class="subhead">Laws of Ine</p>

<p>(20, 43) Most of England is still under woodland.</p>

<p>(25) Trade already considerable (cf. Athelstane, 10, 13).</p>

<p>(42) Farming done in common; use of quickset as well as temporary
hurdle fences.</p>

<p>(44, 49) Important place of swine in Saxon economy.</p>

<p class="subhead">Laws of Alfred</p>

<p>Influence of Church supreme in the form and matter of the laws, the
Mosaic infused among Saxon customary rules.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>(30, 32) Survival of Paganism, possibly reinforced by Danish
influence.</p>

<p>(39) Woodland not yet cleared of wild beasts.</p>

<p class="subhead">Laws of Athelstane</p>

<p>Note here the practice of local minting, now confined to officers
of the Church or King; also the use of horses as well as oxen in farm
labour.</p>

<p>Legislation is now by the King in council and the whole series of
excerpts show the re-establishment of order and royal authority based
on the fundamental principle of loyalty to the oath. The sworn bond
between man and lord was already in Alfred&#8217;s reign the most
sacred, its breach constituting treason for which no money penalty
might atone.</p>

<p class="subhead">Growth of Trade</p>

<p>This is apparent in Alfred&#8217;s laws (34), in Edward&#8217;s
(12), and Athelstane&#8217;s; it is regulated by royal and not by local
authority; and disputes between Dane and Saxon lead to the general
imposition of the rule of &#8220;Commendation&#8221; of landless men to
lords, which gave rise to the Saxon system later called manorial.</p>

<p class="subhead">Boundary Dispute, 896 A.D.</p>

<p>Note the power of the local Witan to try property cases; the
co-operation of bishop and chapter in the grant; the instance of
commendation; the priest&#8217;s position as spokesman of the
villagers.</p>

<p class="subhead">Manorial System</p>

<p>Fitzherbert&#8217;s account of the rise of manors ignores the Saxon
basis for the grouping of tenants under a lord to whom they paid
service for their lands. This system did not begin at the Conquest but
earlier (cf. Ine, 67; Alfred, 23; Athelstane, 8, 10, etc.).</p>

<p>It was in most cases a fair, voluntary bargain (cf. Boundary
Dispute), in which one party owed protection, military and legal,
in return for the labour of the other. This feudal compact enabled
the country to pass through the Danish troubles and consequent
disorder under the leadership of the lords. Once security had been
re-established by the central power of the Angevin kings, both the need
for lords and their sense of responsibility for their men faded and
their power was abused till the economic forces of the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries gave the men a means of resistance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p class="subhead">Custumals of Battle Abbey</p>

<p>It is possible from these details to construct a vivid scene of
manorial life. Owners of ecclesiastical manors were usually more
liberal to their tenants than lay lords. Interesting features are
the work of the lord&#8217;s officer, the Reeve; the fact that while
a half-hide may support a considerable family, the work of only
one member is required to do the services; the ease with which the
elaborate details of the services led to disputes; the ranks of
the various villeins and the consequent difference in the service
each paid; the constant use of barter, goods being paid rather than
money.</p>

<h3>SAXON LAWS OR DOOMS</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(Thorpe, <cite>Ancient Laws and Institutes</cite>)</p>

<h4>ETHELBERT</h4>

<p class="subhead2">(King of Kent, 560-610.) (p. 2)</p>

<p>(5) If a man slay another in the king&#8217;s tun<a
name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a> let him make bot<a name="FNanchor_2_2"
id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
with fifty shillings.</p>

<p>(9) If a freeman steal from a freeman, let him make threefold
bot; and let the king have the wite<a name="FNanchor_3_3"
id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
and all the chattels.</p>

<p>(17) If any one be the first to make an inroad into a man&#8217;s
tun let him make bot with six shillings; let him who follows with three
shillings; after, each, a shilling.</p>

<p>(21) If a man slay another, let him make bot with ... a hundred
shillings.</p>

<p>(24) If any one bind a freeman, let him make bot with twenty
shillings.</p>

<p>(74) Let maiden-bot be as that of a freeman.</p>

<p>(77) If a man buy a maiden with cattle let the bargain
stand, if it be without guile, but if there be guile, let him
bring her home again, and let his property be restored to him.</p>

<h4>OF THE DOOMS OF INE</h4>

<p class="subhead2">(Wessex, 688 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>)
(Ibid. p. 45)</p>

<p>(20) If a far-coming man or a stranger journey through a wood out of
the highway, and neither shout nor blow his horn, he is to be held for
a thief, either to be slain or redeemed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4"
id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>(25) If a chapman traffic up among the people, let him do it before
witnesses....</p>

<p>(40) A ceorl&#8217;s close ought to be fenced winter and summer. If
it be unfenced and his neighbours&#8217; cattle stray in through his
own gap, he shall have nothing from the cattle: let him drive it out
and bear the damage.</p>

<p>(42) If ceorls have a common meadow, or other partible land to
fence, and some have fenced their part, some have not, and (stray
cattle) eat up their common corn or grass, let those go who own the
gap, and compensate to the others who have fenced their part, the
damage which there may be done, and let them demand such justice on the
cattle as it may be right. But if there be a beast that breaks hedges
and goes in everywhere, and he who owns it will nor or cannot restrain
it; let him who finds it in his field take it and slay it, and let the
owner take its skin and flesh and forfeit the rest.</p>

<p>(43) When anyone burns a tree in a wood, and it be found out against
him who did it, let him pay the full wite; let him give sixty shillings
because fire is a thief. If anyone fell in a wood a good many trees,
and be afterwards discovered; let him pay for three trees, each with
thirty shillings. He need not pay for more of them, were there so many
of them as might be; because the axe is an informer, not a thief.</p>

<p>(44) But if anyone cut down a tree under which thirty swine may
stand, and it be discovered let him pay sixty shillings.</p>

<p>(49) If a man among his mast find unallowed swine, then let

<h4>ALFRED&#8217;S DOOMS</h4>

<p class="subhead2">(King of England, 871-901.) (Ibid. p. 20)</p>

<p class="f90">[Alfred&#8217;s Dooms begin with the Ten Commandments
and other regulations taken from the Old Testament.]</p>

<p>(15) He who stealeth a freeman and selleth him, and if it be
proved against him so that he cannot clear himself; let him perish by
death.</p>

<p>(16) If anyone smite his neighbour with a stone or with his fist,
and he nevertheless can go out with a staff, let him get a leech, and
work his work while that himself may not.</p>

<p>(19) If anyone thrust out another&#8217;s eye, let him give his own
for it; tooth for tooth; hand for hand; foot for foot; burning for
burning; wound for wound; stripe for stripe.</p>

<p>(22) If anyone dig a water-pit, or open one that is shut up, and
close it not again; let him pay for whatever cattle may fall therein;
and let him have the dead (beast).</p>

<p>(23) If an ox wound another man&#8217;s ox, and if it then die, let
them sell the (live) ox, and have the worth in common, and also the
flesh of the dead one. But if the lord knew that the ox had used to
push, and he would not confine it, let him give him another ox for it,
and have all the flesh for himself.</p>

<p>(24) If anyone steal another&#8217;s ox, and slay or sell it, let
him give two for it; and four sheep for one. If he have not what he may
give, be he himself sold for the cattle.</p>

<p>(30) The women who are wont to receive enchanters, and workers of
phantasms, and witches, suffer thou not to live:</p>

<p>(32) And let him who sacrificeth to gods, save unto God alone,
perish by death.</p>

<p>(36) If a man have only a single garment wherewith to cover himself,
or to wear, and he give it (to thee) in pledge; let it be returned
before sunset.</p>

<p>(39) All the flesh that wild beasts leave, eat ye not that, but give
it to the dogs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>(43) Judge thou very evenly: judge thou not one doom to the rich,
another to the poor; nor one to thy friend, another to thy foe, judge
thou.</p>

<p>(47) To the stranger and comer from afar behave thou not unkindly,
nor oppress thou him with any wrongs.</p>

<p class="p2">I then, Alfred, king, gathered these together and
commanded many of them to be written which our forefathers held, those
which to me seemed good; many of those which seemed to me not good I
rejected them, by the counsel of my Witan, and in other wise commanded
them to be holden; for I durst not venture to set down in writing much
of my own, for it was unknown to me what of it would please those who
should come after us.</p>

<h4>FURTHER SERIES</h4>

<p>(12) If a man burn or hew another&#8217;s wood without leave, let
him pay for every great tree with five shillings, and afterwards for
each, let there be as many of them as may be, with five pence, and
thirty shillings as wite.</p>

<p>(34) It is also directed to chapmen, that they bring the men whom
they take up with them before the king&#8217;s reeve at the folk-moot,
and let it be stated how many of them there are ... and when they
have need of more men up with them on their journey, let them always
declare it, as often as their need may be, to the king&#8217;s reeve,
in presence of the gemot.</p>

<p>(36) Of heedlessness with a spear.</p>

<p>If a man have a spear over his shoulder, and any man stake
himself upon it, that he pay the <i>wer</i><a name="FNanchor_7_7"

without the wite. If he stake himself before his face, let him pay the
wer. If he be accused of wilfulness in the deed, let him clear himself
according to the wite; and with that let the wite abate. And let this
be if the point be three fingers higher than the hindmost part of the
shaft; if they be both on a level, the point and the hindmost part of
the shaft, be that without danger.</p>

<p class="subhead2">(Ibid. p. 71)</p>

<p>(7) If anyone engage in Sunday marketing, let him forfeit the
chattel, and 12 ores among the Danes, or thirty shillings among the
English. If a freeman work on a festival day let him forfeit his
freedom or pay wite.</p>

<p>(12) If anyone wrong an ecclesiastic or a foreigner through any
means, as to money or as to life, then shall the king or the eorl there

<h4>LAWS OF ATHELSTANE, A.D. 925</h4>

<p class="subhead2">(Ibid. p. 83)</p>

<p class="subhead">Of Landless Men</p>

<p>(8) And we have ordained: if any landless man should become a
follower in another shire, and again seek his kinsfolk; that he may
harbour him on this condition; that he present him to folkright if he
there do any wrong, or make bot for him.</p>

<p>(9) He who attaches cattle, let V of his neighbours be named to him;
and of the V let him get one who will swear with him that he takes it
to himself by folkright: and he who will keep it to himself, to him let
there be named X men, and let him get two of them, and give the oath
that it was born on his property....</p>

<p>(10) And let no man exchange any property without the witness of the
reeve, or of the mass priest, or of the landlord ... or of any other
unlying man....</p>

<p>But if it be found that any of these have given wrongful witness,
that his witness never stand again for aught, and that he also give XXX
shillings as wite.</p>

<p>(12) And we have ordained that no man buy any property out of port<a

class="fnanchor">[8]</a> over XX pence; but let him buy there within
on the witness of the port reeve, or of another unlying man: or
further on the witness of the reeves at the folkmoot.</p> <p><span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>
<p>(13) And we ordain that every burh<a name="FNanchor_9_9"

be repaired XIV days over Rogation Days.</p>

<p>Secondly that every marketing be within port.</p>

<p>(14) Thirdly: that there be one money over all the king&#8217;s
dominions and that no man mint except within port.</p>

<p>And if the moneyer be guilty, let the hand be struck off with which
he wrought the offence, and be set up on the money smithy....</p>

bishop&#8217;s, I the abbot&#8217;s.</p>

<p>(16) Fifthly: that every man have to the plough two well-horsed
men.</p>

<p>(18) Seventhly: that no man part with a horse over sea, unless he
wish to give it.</p>

<p>(24) ... And that no marketing be on Sundays; but if anyone do so,
let him forfeit the goods, and pay XXX shillings as wite.</p>

<p>(26) But if any one of my reeves will not do this, and care less
about it than we have commanded: then let him pay my oferhyrnes<a
name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10"
class="fnanchor">[10]</a>, and I will find another who will. And let
the bishop exact the oferhyrnes of the reeve in whose following it may
be....</p>

<p>All this was established in the great Synod of Greatanlea<a

all the noblemen and witan....</p>

<p>Athelstane, king, makes it known: that I have learned that
our frith<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a
href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> is worse kept than
is pleasing to me, or it at Greatanlea was ordained; and my witan
say that I have too long borne with it. Now I have decreed with
the witan who were with me at Exeter at mid winter; that they [the
Frith breakers], shall all be ready, in themselves and with wives
and property and with all things to go whither I will (unless from
henceforth they shall desist) on this ... condition, that they never
come again to the country ... now that is because the oaths, and the
weds, and the books<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a
href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> are all disregarded
and broken which were there given; and we know of no other things to
trust in except it be this.</p>

becoming: and let marketings and folkmotes be carefully abstained from
on that holy day.</p>

<h4>CHURCH RULES</h4>

<p class="subhead2">(Ibid. p. 472)</p>

<p>We have also seen often in the church, corn, and hay, and all kinds
of peculiar things kept;</p>

<p>Mass priest<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a
href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> ought always to have
at their houses a school of disciples, and if any good man desire to
commit his little ones to them for instruction, they ought very gladly
to receive them, and kindly teach them.... They ought not, however, for
that instruction to desire anything from their relations, except what
they shall be willing to do for them of their own accord....</p>

<p>Also we command those mass priests, who are subjected to us,
that they very earnestly [busy] themselves about the people&#8217;s
learning: that those who are learned in books<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span> frequently and zealously
teach their parishioners from these books, who may not be so far
learned in books.</p>

<h4>BOUNDARY DISPUTE SETTLED, A.D. 896</h4>

<p class="subhead2">(Ibid., p. 139)</p>

<p>&#8220;In that year Ethelred, alderman, summoned all the witan of
the Mercians together at Gloster, bishops and aldermen and all his
chief men, and did that with the knowledge and leave of King Alfred....
Then bishop Werferth made known to the &#8216;witan&#8217; that almost
all the woodland had been reft from him that belonged to Woodchester
which king Ethelbald gave to Worcester in perpetual alms, as mastland
and woodland, to bishop Wilferth ... and then Aethelwald [the occupier]
forthwith declared that he would not oppose the right.... And so very
mildly gave it up to the bishop, and ordered his &#8216;geneat&#8217;
named Eclaf, to ride with the townsmen&#8217;s priest, named Wulfhere;
and he then led him along all the boundaries as he read them to him
from the old books how king Ethelbald had before increased and given
it. Then, however, Aethelwald desired of the bishop and the convent
that they would kindly allow him to enjoy it while he lived, and
Allmund his son; and they would hold it in fee of him and the convent;
and, he never, nor either of them would bereave him of the pannage
right, which he had allowed him in Longridge, for the time in which
God gave it to him.... So did the witan of the Mercians declare it in
the &#8216;gemot&#8217;; and showed him the charters of the land....
And thus the townsmen&#8217;s priest rode it, and Aethelwald&#8217;s
&#8216;geneat&#8217; with him.... Thus did Aethelwald&#8217;s man
point out to him the boundaries as the old charters directed and
indicated.&#8221;</p>

<h3>MANORIAL SYSTEM</h3>

<p class="f90 subhead2">FITZHERBERT&#8217;S ACCOUNT OF THE RISE OF
MANORS</p>

<p class="f90 subhead2">(Sir A. Fitzherbert, Book of Husbandry;
Cunningham, <cite>Growth of English Industry and Commerce</cite>. App. 1, Edition
1882.)</p>

<p>Customary tenants are those that hold their lands of their
lord by copy of court roll, after the custom of the manor.<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span> And
there be many tenants within the same manor, that have no copies and
yet hold by like Custom and service at the will of the lord. And in
mine opinion it began soon after the Conquest, when William Conqueror
had conquered the Realm he rewarded all those that came with him, in
his voyage royal, according to their degree. And to honourable men he
gave lordships, manors, lands and tenements with all the inhabitants,
men and women, dwelling in the same, to do with them at their pleasure.
And those honourable men thought that they must needs have servants and
tenants, and their lands occupied with tillage. Wherefore they pardoned
the inhabitants of their lives, and caused them to do all manner of
service, that was to be done, was it never so vile, and caused them
to occupy their lands and tenements in tillage and took of them such
rents, customs and services as it pleased them to have. And also took
all their goods and cattle at all times at their pleasure, and called
them their bondmen, and since that time many noblemen, both spiritual
and temporal, of their godly disposition, have made to divers of the
said bondmen manumissions and granted them freedom and liberty....
Howbeit, in some places, the bondmen continue as yet the which me
seemeth is the greatest inconvenience that now is suffered by the law,
that is to have any christian bounden to another and to have the rule
of his body, lands or goods, that his wife, children and servants have
laboured for all their lifetime to be so taken, like as an it were
extortion or bribery.</p>

<p>And many times by colour thereof there be many freemen taken as
bondmen, and their lands and goods taken from them, so that they
shall not be able to sue for remedy to prove themselves free of
blood. And that is most commonly when the freemen have the same
name as the bondmen, or that his ancestors, of whom he is come, was
manumized before his birth. In such case there cannot be too great a
punishment.</p>

<p>In many lordships there is a customary roll between a lord and
his tenants, and it ought to be indented, one part to remain in the
lord&#8217;s keeping, the other part with the tenants and divers true
copies to be made of the same, that the rents<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> and customs run not out
of remembrance. And also a suit roll to call all those by name, that
oweth any suit to the lord&#8217;s court and then shall there be no
concealment of the suitors, but that the steward may know who is not
there, and if any suitors decease, the name of his next heir would be
entered into the same roll, and an enquiry made, and presented, what
he held of the lords and by what rents, customs and services of every
parcel by itself, and who is his next heir, and of what age he is of,
and this truly done and entered into the roll, it would be a conveyance
of descent ... and profitable to the lords and also to the tenants.</p>

<h3>BATTLE ABBEY CUSTUMALS</h3>

<p class="f90 subhead2">(<cite>Custumals of Battle Abbey</cite>, Ed., S. R.

<h4>MANOR OF ALSISTUN, SUSSEX (p. XVIII)</h4>

<p>The reeve held one virgate for which he rendered no service so long
as he kept his office.</p>

<h4>CUSTOMARY TENANTS</h4>

<p class="subhead">Services due from each half hide</p>

<p>Every half hide owed to the lord, on every working day, the services
of one man, to do whatever should be required of him;</p>

<p>If thrashing was required three men ought to thrash in a day half
a seam and half a bushel [i.e. 4&frac12; bushels] of corn, or two men
&frac12; seam of barley, or each man 6 bushels of oats; and of beans
and vetches the same quantity as of corn; They were to thrash in
whatever barn they might be directed to do (within the manor) and to
winnow what they had thrashed and carry it to the granary, and if it
were far to the granary to employ their cattle in carrying it;</p>

<p>If ditching was required two men were to make in a day 1 perch of
new ditch, 5 feet in width, or each man to repair 1 perch of old;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13"
id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>If other work was required of them they were to work until their
fellows had finished their work in the barn;</p>

<p>In ploughing and harrowing they were to work until it was time to
unharness the plough.</p>

<p>When they had to break clods, to wash or shear sheep, to hoe corn,
and to mow or gather hay, they were to work the whole day except the
dinner hour;</p>

<p>In addition to the ordinary daywork each &frac12; hide was to find a
man for one day to gather the hay; and also a man to mow and cock hay
for one day; and they were to carry the whole of the hay, each half
hide with two oxen;</p>

<p>If necessary each half hide was to find two men to reap in the
lord&#8217;s field, receiving therefor every tenth sheaf,&mdash;or if
the lord should prefer it, each half hide was to reap in a day an acre
of corn or oats or half an acre of barley or vetches with as many men
as they chose, receiving every tenth sheaf;</p>

<p>They were to carry all the corn, each half hide with two oxen;</p>

<p>Also each half hide was to find two men and two oxen to cart manure
till it was all carted away;</p>

<p>To plough one acre for corn once and to sow half of it, providing
the seed;</p>

<p>To plough one acre for barley twice, and two acres for oats once,
to carry the seed for the same from the granary to the field, and to
harrow the same;</p>

<p>Every half hide was also to carry 4 loads of wood yearly to the
lord&#8217;s hearth, and when he was building, a cartload of timber;</p>

<p>If it were necessary to fetch grain from Seford or elsewhere near,
each half hide was to go with one beast twice a day or if further, once
a day, such service being reckoned as one day&#8217;s work;</p>

<p>Each was also to provide and make four rafters with the
appurtenances, and the roofing for the lord&#8217;s sheepcote except
with great timber, this being reckoned as two day&#8217;s work;</p>

<p>Also to carry to Battle every Monday; if however the tenant&#8217;s
mare was dead or foaling, he was to be quit from one averagium but he
was to work instead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14"

<h4>DUTIES OF FOUR COTTARS (p. XX)</h4>

<p>From Michaelmas to hoeing time to perform two days&#8217; work
a week, namely on Monday and Wednesday; and (as they say) do no
other works except to thrash, to break clods, and to spread hay when
necessary;</p>

<p>At Christmas each was to carry to Battle 12 hens, and at Easter 250
eggs, and they were to be free from work for twelve days at Christmas
and &#8220;a die Paraceves&#8221;, from Holy Friday to the octaves of
Easter;</p>

<p>They were to hoe whenever there was anything to be hoed, to attend
to the sheepshearing, and at haytime and harvest each to find one man
for the whole time.</p>

GILDS</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTORY NOTES</h3>

<p class="subhead">Winchester</p>

<p>An example of full rights of self-government, the city electing its
own Mayor and other officers. Citizens are entitled to attend the moot,
but are already becoming a close oligarchy, &#8220;every worker&#8221;
not being admitted to the freedom of the city.</p>

<p>Note that shops are uncommon, goods are usually sold at booths
erected in market or street.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Great Gild&#8221; is the Merchant gild comprising all
traders; the various crafts have their own gilds but are subject to
the Mayor as representative of the Gild Merchant out of which in this
case the corporation appears to have arisen, the townhall being called
the Gildhall, and rules being enforced to maintain a high standard
in commodities sold. The town dues and regulations tend to check the
natural growth of industry and to restrict it in favour of freemen of
the city.</p>

<p class="subhead">Bristol</p>

<p>Note here that the crafts are clearly subjected to the Mayor of
a Merchant Gild, who has also acquired the right to hold view of
frank-pledge, etc.</p>

<p>The Gild of Fullers shows the importance in medi&aelig;val gilds
attached to keeping up a sound standard of work and value. Thus in
addition to protecting their own members as a Trades Union does, they
also protected the consumer and general public.</p>

<p class="subhead">Adam of Gloucester</p>

<p>Here is a case of an outsider claiming the rights of a freeman and
resisting the town authority by pleading the king&#8217;s. Thus his
case is heard in the king&#8217;s court of Common Bench and not in
either the Mayor&#8217;s Court or the Shiremoot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16"
id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>The extract from the <cite>Hereford Iter</cite> appears to refer to the same
clothier. It illustrates the growth of a demand for written evidence,
the lawyer throwing scorn on the value of the tally, though tallies
had been commonly used at the king&#8217;s Exchequer. The reference to
Law Merchant should be noted. Edward I by the Statute of Acton Burnell
in 1283 had established courts in certain boroughs in which merchants
might have merchant law for the recovery of debts.</p>

<p class="subhead">Gild of St. Michael, Lincoln</p>

<p>This extract describes the normal doings of a gild, it is of special
interest that it insists on equality among its members.</p>

<p class="subhead">Gild of Tailors, Exeter</p>

<p>Letters Patent, or Charters were often merely confirmations of
an already existing gild, sometimes probably dating from Saxon days
but having fresh occasion to fear interference on the part of a
neighbouring lord or the king, written records having now become
the rule in cases of tenure of property. Such charters were often
submitted to succeeding kings for confirmation, and where this was not
done Charles II was able to make large sums by calling in the ancient
charters. This record also shows well the efforts made to keep up
a good standard of work, and the extent of the jurisdiction of the
gild-authorities.</p>

<p class="subhead">The Livery Companies</p>

<p>Stow&#8217;s account is inserted here to show the unbroken
succession of these voluntary associations from Saxon to modern days;
though at the Reformation they lost their religious character.</p>

<p>The later trading companies are closely akin to these, but lack the
main motive of mutual charity, though they too exist to co-operate in
work for which the individuals&#8217; efforts would not suffice. The
earliest of them, the Merchant Adventurers, did actually begin as the
religious gild of S. Thomas of Canterbury, being joined by Flemings
holding a charter to trade from John of Brabant.</p>

<h4>GILD MASTERS SANCTIONED BY THE MAYOR</h4>

<p class="subhead2">(Toulmin Smith, p. 420)</p>

<p>It hath been used, the Mayor to let summon all the masters of the
Bakers, Brewers, Butchers, and of all other crafts of the town, to come
before him, and then to go and assemble them at their halls and places
accustomed, to the election of their masters for the year following,
and thereupon to bring their said masters and present them before the
Mayor, there to take their oaths in the Mayor&#8217;s presence.</p>

<p>It hath been used, that within a month after Michaelmas Day, the
Mayor, Sheriff and Bailiffs of Bristol, to hold their Lawday in the
Guildhall, by the town clerk of the same town, there to call, first
the whole Council of Bristol, without any fines accepted for absence,
and after that to call all freeholders and common suitors upon pain of
fines, and then to call the constables of every Ward. And so to proceed

<h3>PETITION OF THE GILD OF FULLERS OF BRISTOL TO THE TOWN AUTHORITIES
(p. 284)</h3>

<p>To the honourable and discreet sirs, the Mayor, sheriff,
and all other honourable burgesses of the Common Council<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span> of the
same town, humbly pray the Masters of the craft of Fullers of the said
town: Whereas the said craft has, of old time, had divers ordinances
enrolled before you of record in the Gihald of Bristol, in order to put
out and do away with all kinds of bad work and deceits which divers
people, not knowing the craft, from time to time do, as well in fulling
cloths as in &#8220;pleityng&#8221; and &#8220;rekkyng&#8221; and many
other defects in the said cloths; by which defects the town and craft
are fallen into bad repute in many places where the said cloths are put
to sale, to the great reproach and hindrance of the said craft.</p>

<p>Wherefore may it please your very wise discretions and honourable
wisdom, to grant to the said suppliants that all their good ordinances
of old time entered of record, and not repealed, be firmly held and
kept and duly put in execution; and that four good men of the said
craft be chosen by them every year, and sworn before the Mayor loyally
to present all manner of defects which hereafter shall be found
touching the said craft, with power, twice a week, to oversee such
defects, and, likewise to keep watch over the servants and workmen
of the same craft, within the franchise of Bristol, so that the said
servants and workmen should not take more wages than of old time is
accustomed and ordained.</p>

<p>And besides, discreet sirs, may it please you to grant to the said
suppliants the new additions and points below written, to the profit
and amendment of the said craft, and to the honour of the said town.</p>

<p>First, it is ordained and agreed that, each year four men of the
craft shall be chosen as Masters, to search every house of the said
craft, twice a week, and oversee all defects in the said cloths, if any
such there be; and to present them before you at the court; so that
whosoever does such bad work shall pay for the same the full price of
the cloth: one half to go to the town, and the other half to the craft,
without any pardon or release: and this, over and above all reasonable
amends made to the buyer of the cloths.</p>

<p>Also, the Masters of the craft shall not give more to the men of
the said craft than fourpence a day.... And if any of the masters
pays more to the workmen than is above ordained, he shall be fined
each time ijs; that is to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21"
id="Page_21">[21]</a></span> xij.d. to the commonalty, and xij.d. to
the craft. And if the men take more from the masters, they shall pay,
each time xij.d.; that is to say, vj.d. to the commonalty, and vi.d. to
the craft. And if the men are rebels or contrarious, and will not work,
then the four Masters shall have power to take them before the Mayor
and Court of Gihald of the town, to be there dealt with according to
law and reason. And moreover the said servants shall work and rest in
their craft, as well by night as by day, all the year, as has of old
time been accustomed.</p>

<p class="subhead2">(<cite>Edward I Yearbook; Pleas in Common Bench, p.

<p>1292. &#8220;One Adam brought (suit against the town bailiffs)
and said that they had tortiously taken his chattels in the town of
Gloucester, in the high street, and had taken them away to their
toll-booth in the same town tortiously ... bailiffs of the town averred
the taking as good; by reason that the custom of the town of Gloucester
is this, that no one unless he be a freeman of the town may cut cloth
in the said town, but that he can only sell it by the piece; yet
nevertheless Adam, who is not a freeman of the town, came and cut his
cloth in opposition to the custom.... Adam put forward a charter which
witnessed that the king had granted to him that he might cut cloth in
the same way as other freemen.&#8221;</p>

<h3>GILD OF ST. MICHAEL ON THE HILL, LINCOLN</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(Toulmin Smith, <cite>English Gilds</cite>, p. 178)</p>

<p class="subhead2">[Summary]</p>

<p>[The gild was founded on Easter Eve, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>
1350.]</p>

<p>On the death of a brother or sister within the city, not only
shall the Dean bring the four wax lights which are called &#8220;soul
candles,&#8221; and fulfil all other usual ceremonies, but the banner
of the gild shall be brought to the house of the dead, and there openly
shown, that men may know that the dead was a brother or sister of the
gild; and this banner shall be carried, with a great torch burning,
from the house of the dead, before the body, to the church.</p>

<p>On the eve of the feast of Corpus Christi, and on the eve of the day
following, all the bretheren and sisteren shall come together as is the
custom, to the gildfeast. At the close of the feast four wax lights
having been kindled, and four of the tankards which are called flagons
having been filled with ale, a clerk shall read and explain these
ordinances, and afterwards the [ale in the] flagons shall be given to
the poor.</p>

<p>If any brother or sister goes away from Lincoln for a year, not
being on pilgrimage, and afterwards seeks to rejoin the gild, he must
pay twelve pence: if away for two years, he must pay two shillings,
unless he have grace.</p>

<p>Whoever seeks to be received into the gild, being of the same rank
as the bretheren and sisteren who founded it, namely of the rank of
common and middling folks, shall be charged to be faithful to the gild,
and shall bear his share of its burdens.</p>

<p>And whereas this gild was founded by folks of common and middling
rank, it is ordained that no one of the rank of mayor or bailiff shall
become a brother of the gild, unless he be found to be of humble, good,
and honest conversation, and is admitted by the choice and common
assent of the bretheren and sisteren of the gild. And none shall meddle
in any matter, unless especially summoned; nor shall such a one take
on himself any office in the gild. He shall on his admission be<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span> sworn
before the bretheren and sisteren, to maintain and keep the ordinances
of the gild. And no one shall have any claim to office in this gild on
account of the honour and dignity of his personal rank.</p>

<p>If any brother or sister of the gild has fallen into such an ill
state that he is unable to earn his living, and has not the means
of supporting himself, he shall have, day by day, a penny from the
bretheren and sisteren of the gild, in the order in which their names
stand on the register of their admission to the gild; each brother or
sister giving the penny in turn out of his own means.</p>

shall have a general control over the craft of tailors, and over others
joining the gild, and their crafts; and may, with the consent of the

<h3>THE LIVERY COMPANIES</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(Stow, <cite>Survey of London</cite>, Book V, p. 165.)</p>

<p>These Companies severally at sundry times purchased the King&#8217;s
Favour and License by his Letters Patents to associate themselves in
Brotherhoods, with Master and Wardens, for their Government.... And
such Liveries have they taken upon them, as well before as since they
were by License associated into Brotherhoods or Corporations.</p>

<p>For the first of these Companies that I read of to be a Guild,
Brotherhood or Fraternity in this City, were the Weavers, whose
Guild was confirmed by Henry the Second. The next Fraternity, which
was of St. John Baptist, time out of mind, called of Taylors,
and Linnen Armourers of London, I find that King Edward I in the
28th of his Reign, confirmed that Guild.... The other Companies
have since purchased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27"
id="Page_27">[27]</a></span> License of Societies, Brotherhoods, or
Corporations in the Reigns of Edward III, Richard II, Henry IV, Henry
V, Henry VI, Edward IV, etc.... The Coverture of Men&#8217;s Heads was
then Hoods ... in the Guildhall, the Maior is ... pictured, sitting
in his Habit party coloured, and a Hood on his Head, his Swordbearer
before him with an Hat or Cap of Maintenance: The Common Clerk and
other Officers bareheaded, their Hoods on their Shoulders.... These
Hoods were worn, the Roundlets upon their Heads, the Skirts to hang
behind their Necks to keep them warm, the Tippet to lie on their
Shoulder or to wind about their Necks. These Hoods were in old time
made in Colours according to their Gowns.... But now ... they have used
their Gowns to be all of one Colour and that the Saddest.</p>

<h3>THE COMPANY OF SKINNERS, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1598</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(Stow, Book II, p. 201)</p>

<p>This Company of Skinners in London was incorporate by Edward III
therefore divers royal Persons were named to be Founders and Brethren
of this Fraternity, to wit, Kings six, Dukes nine, Earls two, one
Lord.</p>

<p>This Fraternity had also once every year on Corpus Christi Day,
after Noon, a Procession which passed through the principal Streets
of the City. Wherein was borne more than one hundred Torches of Wax
(costly garnished) burning light, and above two hundred Clerks and
Priests in Surplices and Copes, singing. After the which were the
Sheriffs Servants, the Clerks of the Compters, Chaplains or the
Sheriffs, the Maiors Serjeants, the Councel of the City, the Maior and
Aldermen in Scarlet, and then the Skinners in their best Liveries.</p>

<p>Thus much to stop the Tongues of unthankful Men, such as use to ask,
Why have ye not noted this, Or that, and give no thanks for what is
done.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) This oath of personal homage to King was an all-important
innovation and one of the reasons why Britain emerged from feudalism

<p>(<i>f</i>) An exaggerated statement. The Norman ceremonies of knighthood
seem to have differed little. All these practices were included in
the full Elizabethan ceremony, which lasted two days. The custom
of conveying land by means of some symbol of it or of the service
returned, such as the transfer of a sod or a sword, was derived from
the practices of European tribes in the primitive semi-nomad stage.</p>

<p class="subhead">The Burning of Croyland</p>

<p>The servants in the vill would be the tenants of the abbey, living
around it in their village huts, farming its lands and doing<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span> other
services. The roofs of monastic houses were either of thatch or lead.
Where lead was used the immense amount of it constituted valuable
plunder. This was a large item in the spoils made by the court of Henry
VIII on the dissolution.</p>

<p>Junior monks were under the charge of a novice, master or Librarian
and spent some time each morning between services in studying in the
north-west cloisters. Their books and rolls were kept in cupboards
built against the angle formed by the south wall of the nave and the
south transept, the most secure and dry spot available.</p>

<p>Astronomy was studied by the Arabs (cf. Psalms of David for Oriental
view of the heavens). These mingled with Italians when they held the
Mediterranean coasts, from about <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 700
onwards. The Emperor Frederick II encouraged this intercourse and so
Europe learned from them the elements of mathematics, science and
geography. Note that the contributions for re-building the abbey are
made in kind, showing the use of barter to be still normal rather than
currency.</p>

<p class="subhead">Life of Abbot Ingulf</p>

<p>This life brings out forcibly the importance of Church intercourse
in promoting international relations and preventing insularity.
Monastic communities even in Britain were rarely if ever entirely
British; they were international hostelries and libraries, centres
of international pilgrimage and trade; often under the direction of
a foreigner, e.g., Anselm, Stephen Harding of Citeaux; the Papacy
thus also international. Note the cosmopolitan company and the divers
objects of the crusaders, Norman monks and knights, German bishops,
Genoese sailors, Christian merchants, Syrians and Greeks.</p>

<p>The contribution rendered to William by Fontenelle is typical of the
feudal aid given on exceptional occasions.</p>

<p>Another noteworthy point is the reception of visiting monks at
Croyland for long periods and in great numbers.</p>

<p class="subhead">Thirteenth Century Explorers</p>

<p>The reports of Carpini and Rubruquis shew a further development of
the travelling activity of the Church. Though less influential than the
explorations of the sixteenth century, these travels gave almost the
only information of the East after the Crusades. They are also valuable
illustrations of nomad life. Many children delight in such material as
M. Polo&#8217;s descriptions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30"
id="Page_30">[30]</a></span> the vivid colour of which is a useful
relief to the drabness of modern town life, wakening a sense of the
wonder and beauty of other existences.</p>

<h3>ABBEY OF CROYLAND</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(<cite>Ingulf&#8217;s Chronicle of Croyland.</cite> Tr. by H.
T. Riley)</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Croyland consisting of fenny lands, it was not able to support
a foundation of stone; wherefore the king [Ethelbald] ordered huge
piles of oak and beech in countless numbers to be driven into the
ground, and solid earth to be brought by water in boats a distance
of nine miles, from a place called Upland, and to be thrown into the
marsh. And thus whereas the holy Guthlac had been previously content
with an oratory made of wood, he both began and finished a church,
founded a convent, enriched the place with decorations and lands. (p.
8.)</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) [c. <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 892]. In years of drought
... [the abbots] put their marshes into a state of cultivation ... and
for three or four years had fruit a hundredfold for all the seed sown
... the monastery was enriched beyond measure in consequence; and so
great was the abundance of corn, that it was able to relieve the whole
adjacent country therewith; while, from the resort thither of countless
multitudes of needy people, the vill became very greatly increased (p.
107).</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) [c. <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1013] this year the
inundations had increased to an unusual degree in consequence of the
frequent showers, and consequently rendered the neighbouring fens, as
also the marshlands adjoining thereto, impassable. Accordingly all the
population repaired thereto, and infinite multitudes flocked to the
spot; the choir and the cloisters were filled with monks, the rest of
the church with priests and clerks, and the whole abbey with laymen;
while the cemetery was filled night and day with women and children
under tents (p. 114).</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) [<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1085] ... in (account
of) our settlement at Croyland, no villeins, bordars, or socmen<a
name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18"
class="fnanchor">[18]</a> are put down, as is the case in our
other lands; for, except through fear of<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span> impending war, few or
none would persevere in living with us. For, in the same way that on
war breaking out, all of the neighbouring country, rich as well as
poor, men as well as women, resorted to Croyland from every side, as
a place of refuge, so again on the serenity of peace being restored
by the Lord, all, returning homewards, quitted our monastery; our own
household of domestics, together with their wives and children, being
the only persons left; to whom ... I have lately demised a great part
of the marshes and meadows of the seat of our monastery, for a certain
annual rent, and the performance of other services; letting to some the
same to farm for a certain number of years, and conveying it to others
in fee for the purposes of cultivation.</p>

<h3>DOMESDAY RECORDS</h3>

<p>(<i>e</i>) The illustrious king William ... on his return to England
[1085 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>] commanded everyone of its people
to do him homage at London, and to swear fealty to him against all men.
He then proceeded to mark out the land so that there was not a hide of
land in all England but what he knew the value and the owner thereof;
nor was there a piece of water or any place but what the same was
described in the king&#8217;s roll; while the rents and profits of the
property itself, and the possessor thereof were set forth for the royal
notice by the trustworthy report of the valuers, who were chosen out of
every district to describe their own neighbourhood.... This register
was called the &#8220;Winchester roll,&#8221; and in consequence of
its containing in full all the tenements throughout the whole country,
received from the English the name of &#8220;Domesday.&#8221; (p.
159.)</p>

<p>King Alfred had formerly published a register of a similar
nature and closely resembling it, in which he described the
whole land of England by counties, hundreds and decuries<a
name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19"
class="fnanchor">[19]</a> ... this too was called the &#8220;Winchester
roll&#8221; because it was deposited and kept at Winchester,
that city being then the capital of his hereditary kingdom
of Wessex.... In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32"
id="Page_32">[32]</a></span> later roll ... there were described,
not only the counties, hundreds, decuries, woods, forests, and all
the vills, but throughout the whole territory it was stated how
many carucates<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a
href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> of land there were,
how many roods, how many acres, what pasture lands there were, what
marshes, what tenements, and who were the tenants thereof.</p>

<h3>KNIGHTHOOD, C. <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1066</h3>

<p>(<i>f</i>) It was the custom among the English that he who was about to
be lawfully consecrated a knight, should, the evening before the day
of his consecration, with contrition and compunction make confession
of all his sins, before some bishop, abbot, monk or priest, and should
after being absolved, pass the night in a church, giving himself up
to prayer, devotion and mortification. On the following day he was to
hear mass, and to make offering of a sword upon the altar, and after
the Gospel, the priest was to bless the sword, and with his blessing to
lay it upon the neck of the knight; on which after having communicated
at the same mass in the sacred mysteries of Christ, he became a lawful
knight. The Normans held in abomination this mode of consecrating a
knight, and did not consider such a person to be a lawful knight, but a
mere tardy trooper and a degenerate plebian. (p. 147.)</p>

<p>And not only in this custom but in many others as well did the
Normans effect a change, for the Normans condemned the English
method of executing deeds; which up to the time of King Edward had
been confirmed by the subscription of the faithful present, with
golden crosses and other sacred signs, and which chirographs<a
name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21"
class="fnanchor">[21]</a> they were in the habit of calling charters.
The Normans were also in the habit of confirming deeds with wax
impressions, made by the especial seal of each person, with the
subscription thereto of three or four witnesses then present. At
first many estates were transferred simply by word of mouth, without
writing or charter, and only with the sword, helmet, horn, or cup
of the owner; while many tenements were conveyed with a spur,
a body scraper, a bow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33"
id="Page_33">[33]</a></span> and some with an arrow. This, however, was
only the case at the beginning of this reign, for in after years the
custom was changed (p. 142).</p>

<h3>BURNING OF CROYLAND ABBEY</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(Ingulf, p. 197)</p>

<p>A most dreadful misfortune befell ... through a most dreadful
conflagration.... For, our plumber being engaged in the tower of the
church, repairing the rood, he neglected to put out his fire in the
evening; but ... covered it over with dead ashes that he might get more
early to work in the morning, and then came down to his supper.</p>

<p>After supper was over all our servants had betaken themselves to
bed, when after the deepest sleep had taken possession of them all,
a most violent north wind arose, and so hastened on this greatest
of misfortunes that could possibly befall us. For as it entered the
tower in every direction through the open gratings, and blew upon the
dead ashes, it caused the fire thus fanned into life, to communicate
with the adjoining timbers.... The people in the vill for a long time
perceived a great glare of light in the belfry, and supposing it was
either the clerks of the church or else the plumber busily engaged at
some work there; but at last on seeing the flames bursting forth, with
loud outcries they knocked at the gate of the monastery. This was about
the dead of night, when all of us, resting in our beds, were in our
first and soundest sleep. At last I was aroused from slumbers by the
loud shouts of the people, and hastening to the nearest window, I most
distinctly perceived, as though it had been midday all the servants
of the monastery running from every quarter, shouting and hallooing,
towards the church. Still in my night clothes I awoke my companions
and descended in all haste to the cloisters, which were lighted up on
all sides just as though there had been a thousand lamps burning. On
running to the door of the church and trying to effect an entrance,
I was prevented from so doing by the melted brass of the bells which
was pouring down, and the heated lead which in like manner was
falling in drops. Upon this I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34"
id="Page_34">[34]</a></span> retreated and looked in at the windows and
on finding the flames everywhere prevailing, turned my steps towards
the dormitory ... of the brethren....</p>

<p>On recognising my voice, full of alarm, they sprang up from their
beds, and half naked, and clad only in their night-clothes, the instant
they heard the fire in the cloisters, rushed forth through all the
windows of the Dormitory, and fell to the ground with dreadful force;
many were wounded and severely shaken by the severity of the fall, and
shocking to relate, some had their limbs broken. The flames, however,
in the meanwhile, growing stronger and stronger, and continually
sending forth flakes from the church in the direction of the Refectory,
first communicated with the Chapter house, then they caught the
Dormitory, and after that the Refectory, and at the same instant the
Ambulatory, which was near the Infirmary. After this they extended
their ravages with a sudden outburst, to the whole of the Infirmary,
with all the adjoining offices. All the brethren flying for refuge to
the spot where I stood in the court, on seeing most of them half-naked,
I attempted to regain my chamber, in order to distribute the clothes
which I had there, among such as I saw stand in the greatest need
thereof; but so great was the heat that had taken possession of all
the approaches to the Hall, and so vast were the torrents of molten
lead that were pouring down in every direction, that it rendered
it impossible for even the boldest of the young men to effect an
entrance.... (p. 199).</p>

<p>At this moment, the tower of the Church falling on its south side I
was so stunned by the crash, that I fell to the ground half dead and in
a swoon. Being raised by my brethren and carried to our porter&#8217;s
room, I was scarcely able, until morning, to recover my right senses or
my usual strength....</p>

<p>About the third hour of the day, the flames being now greatly
subdued, we effected an entry into the church, and water being carried
thither, extinguished the fire there, which had now pretty well
burned out. In the choir, which was reduced to ashes, we found all
the books of the holy office utterly destroyed, both Antiphonaries
as well as Gradals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35"
id="Page_35">[35]</a></span> On entering the vestiary, however, we
found all our sacred vestments and the relics of the Saints, as well
as some other precious things deposited there untouched by the flames,
the place being covered with a double roof of stone. Going upstairs
into our muniment room, we found that, although it had been covered
throughout with an arching of stone, the fire had still made its way
through the wooden windows; and that, although the presses themselves
appeared to be quite safe and sound, still all our muniments therein
were burnt into one mass, and utterly destroyed by the intense heat of
the fire, just as though they had been in a furnace red hot or an oven
at a white heat. Our charters of extreme beauty, written in capital
letters, adorned with golden crosses and paintings of the greatest
beauty, and formed of materials of matchless value, which had been
there deposited, were all destroyed. The privileges also, granted by
the kings of the Mercians, documents of extreme antiquity, and of the
greatest value, which were likewise most exquisitely adorned with
pictures in gold, but written in Saxon characters, were all burnt. The
whole of these muniments of ours, both great and small, nearly four
hundred in number, were in one moment of a night, which proved to us of
blackest hue, by a most shocking misfortune, lost and utterly destroyed
(p. 200).</p>

<p>A few years before, however, I had of my own accord, taken from our
muniment room several charters written in Saxon characters, and as we
had duplicates of them, and in some instances triplicates, I had put
them in the hands of our chauntor, the lord Fulmar, to be kept in the
cloisters, in order to instruct the juniors in a knowledge of the Saxon
characters; as this kind of writing had for a long time, on account of
the Normans, been utterly neglected, and was now understood by only a
few of the more aged men.... These charters having been deposited in an
ancient press, which was kept in the cloisters, and surrounded on every
side by the wall of the church, were the only ones that were saved and
preserved from the fire.... (p. 201).</p>

<p>The whole of our library also perished, which contained more than
three hundred volumes of original works, besides smaller volumes more
than four hundred in number. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36"
id="Page_36">[36]</a></span> also lost at the same time an astronomical
table of extreme beauty and costliness, wonderfully formed of all
kinds of metal, according to the various natures of the stars and
constellations. Saturn was made of copper, Jupiter of gold, Mars of
iron, the Sun of latten, Mercury of bronze, Venus of tin, and the Moon
of silver.... Throughout all England there was not such another Nadir
known or heard of. The king of France had formerly presented it ... to
the library of the convent, both as an ornament and for the instruction
of the younger brethren, and now it was consumed by the voracious
flames and so annihilated.</p>

<p>The whole of our Chapter house was burnt. Our Dormitory ... our
Infirmary ... our Refectory ... the kitchens also adjoining, and the
hall and chamber of the lay brethren, with all the contents thereof,
were consumed by the fire. Our cellar also, as well as the very casks
filled with beer were destroyed. The abbot&#8217;s hall, too, and his
chamber together with the entire courtyard of the monastery....</p>

<p>A few cottages of the poor corodiers,<a name="FNanchor_22_22"
id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22"
class="fnanchor">[22]</a> the stalls of our beasts of burden, with the
sheds for the other cattle, that stood at a considerable distance, and
were covered with stone, were the only things that remained unconsumed.
Besides the northern transept of the church, from which the wind
drove onwards with most impetuous force towards the south, all the
buildings of the monastery, and especially those covered with lead,
whether formed of wood or of stone, our charters and jewels, books
and utensils, bells and belfries, vestments and provisions, were in a
moment of time lost and consumed, myself, to my most bitter sorrow,
being then the head of the convent....</p>

<p>The news of our dreadful misfortune being speedily spread ...
numbers of our neighbours ... had compassion.... Remigius, bishop of
Lincoln, graciously granted an indulgence of forty days to all who
should do us any service.... He also gave us forty marks in money....
Lincoln sent us one hundred marks. Richard de Rulos ... a most loving
friend, gave us ten quarters of wheat, ten quarters of malt,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span> ten
quarters of peas, ten quarters of beans, and ten pounds in silver.</p>

<p>Haco of Multon also, at the same time gave us twelve quarters of
wheat, and twenty fat bacon hogs.... Elsin of Pyncebek also gave one
hundred shillings in silver, and ten bacon hogs. Ardnot of Spalding
likewise gave us six quarters of corn, two carcases of oxen, and twelve
bacon hogs. Many others also presented us with various gifts.... Nor
should among so many of our benefactors, the holy memory of Juliana, a
poor old woman of Weston, be consigned to oblivion, who, &#8220;of her
want&#8221; did give unto us &#8220;all her living,&#8221; namely, a
great quantity of spun thread, for the purpose of sewing the vestments
of the brethren of our monastery (p. 203.)</p>

<h3>LIFE OF AN ABBOTT. ELEVENTH CENTURY</h3>

<p>Now I, Ingulf, the humble servant of St. Guthlac and his monastery
of Croyland, a native of England and the son of parents who were of
the most beauteous city of London, being in my tender years destined
for the pursuits of literature, was sent to study first at Westminster
and afterwards at Oxford. After I had made progress beyond most of my
fellows in mastering Aristotle, I clothed myself down to the heels with
the first and second Rhetoric of Tully. On growing to be a young man, I
loathed the narrow means of my parents and daily longed ... to leave my
parental home, sighing for the palaces of kings or princes.... Just at
this time, William, ... who was then as yet duke of Normandy only came
over with a great retinue of followers to London.... Enrolling myself
in the number of these, I exerted myself in the performance of all
kinds of weighty business ... and becoming a very great favourite with
him, returned with him to Normandy (p. 147).</p>

<p>Being there appointed his secretary, at my own will I ruled the
whole of the duke&#8217;s court, incurring thereby the envy of some....
Just then it was noised about ... that many archbishops of the Empire,
together with some other of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38"
id="Page_38">[38]</a></span> princes of the land, were desirous ... to
proceed on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Upon this several of the household of the duke, both knights as
well as clerks, among whom I was the first and foremost, with the ...
goodwill of our master, the duke ... taking the road for Germany, being
more than thirty horsemen in number ... joined his lordship of Mentz<a
name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23"
class="fnanchor">[23]</a>.... In company with their lordships,
the bishops, there were reckoned seven thousand persons, who
prosperously traversed various regions, and at last arrived at
Constantinople. Here, addressing our prayers to its emperor, Alexius<a
name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24"
class="fnanchor">[24]</a>, we saw the Saint Sophia, and kissed its
sanctuaries, so infinite in number.</p>

<p>Departing thence and taking our way through Lycia, we fell into the
hands of Arabian robbers, and being plundered of an immense amount
of money, and many of us being put to death, only escaped with the
greatest difficulty and at the extreme peril of our lives, and at
length joyously made our entrance into the much longed for city of
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>We were received by Sophronius, the then Patriarch, a man venerable
for his grey hairs, and most holy and most upright, with a great crash
of cymbals and an immense blaze of torches at the most divine church of
the most Holy Sepulchre, a solemn procession being formed of Latins as
well as Syrians. What prayers we here uttered, what tears we shed, what
sighs we heaved, the inhabitant thereof, our Lord Jesus Christ alone
knoweth ... (p. 148).</p>

<p>But some robbers of Arabs, who kept a watch upon all the road, would
not allow us ... to wander any distance from the city. Accordingly,
on the arrival of spring, a fleet of Genoese ships arrived in the
port of Joppa. On board of these we all embarked, after the Christian
merchants had exchanged their wares throughout the maritime cities
... and so committed ourselves to the sea. After being tossed by
waves and storms innumerable we arrived at last at Brundusium,
and then making a prosperous journey through Apulia, repaired to
Rome.... Then the archbishops and other princes of the Empire
returned to Germany, taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39"
id="Page_39">[39]</a></span> the way to the right, while we turned to
the left on our way to France, taking leave of each other, with kind
words and kisses of inexpressible fervency on both sides. And thus at
last, instead of our number of thirty horsemen, who took our departure
from Normandy in excellent condition, hardly twenty returned, poor
pilgrims and all on foot, attenuated and famished in the extreme....
In order that I might not in future be involved in the vanities of
this world ... I took refuge in the holy convent of Fontenelle.... At
length, after not a few years ... the lord abbot, Gerbert ... appointed
me prior of his monastery, bound as I was, by the ties of duty, to obey
(p. 149).</p>

<p>At this time, my lord William ... was long waiting at the port of
St. Valery for a favourable wind, it being his intention to cross
over, in order to assert his rights. Thither I then repaired with the
subsidy offered by my lord the abbot, and ... presented twelve chosen
youths, on horses and supplied with arms, together with a hundred marks
for their expenses, as his contribution, on behalf of my father the
abbot. Being most abundantly thanked for so welcome a present, and
having obtained (the duke&#8217;s) charter of donation for ever to our
house of ... vineyards, ... overjoyed and exulting, I returned to our
monastery....</p>

<p>In the course of some years ... king William, sending a messenger
... to Gerbert ... to enquire for my humble self ... placed me, with
mingled feelings, of extreme sorrow at assuming such a heavy burden of
responsibility, and of extreme delight at seeing myself transferred to
my native soil ... in the church of Croyland.... I was installed there
in the year of our Lord, 1076 (p. 150).</p>

<p>I found in this monastery [of Croyland] of which, by the will of
God I am a servant, sixty-two monks, of whom four were lay brethren,
besides monks of other monasteries, who were making profession of the
monastic life there, together with those of our chapter. All these when
they came, had stalls in our choir, seats in our refectory, and beds
in our dormitory. These, too, exceeded one hundred in number, and just
when they pleased, some after the expiration of half a year, and some
after a whole year, they returned to their<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> own monasteries; and this,
more especially in time of war ... so did they flock from every quarter
to Croyland (p. 152).</p>

<h3>EXPLORATIONS</h3>

<p class="f90 hanging"><cite>The Voyage of Johannes de Plano Carpini
into the North East parts of the World, in the year of our Lord,
1246.</cite></p>

<p>(Hakluyt Soc., <cite>Carpini and Rubruquis</cite>, Beasley, p. 107)</p>

<p class="subhead">Chapter II</p>

<p>About this time also, Pope Innocent the Fourth sent Friar Ascelline,
being one of the order of the Praedicants, together with three other
Friars ... with letters apostolical unto the Tartars camp: wherein he
exhorted them to give over their bloody slaughter of mankind, and to
receive the Christian faith.... And at that very time also, there was
a certain other Friar Minorite, namely Friar John de Plano Carpini,
sent with certain associates unto the Tartars, who likewise (as himself
witnesses) abode and conversed with them a year and three months at the
least.</p>

<p class="subhead">Chapter IV</p>

<p>The Mongols or Tartars, in outward shape, are unlike to all other
people. For they are broader between the eyes, and the balls of their
cheeks, than men of other nations be. They have flat and small noses,
little eyes, and eyelids standing straight upright, they are shaven on
the crown like priests.... Their habitations be round and cunningly
made with wickers and staves in manner of a tent. But in the midst of
the tops thereof, they have a window open to convey the light in and
the smoke out. For their fire is always in the midst. Their walls be
covered with felt. Their doors are made of felt also. Some of these
Tabernacles may quickly be taken asunder and set together again, and
are carried upon beasts&#8217; backs. Other some cannot be taken in
sunder, but are stowed upon carts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41"
id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>... They are very rich in cattle, as in camels, oxen, sheep and
goats. And I think they have more horses and mares than all the world
besides. But they have no kine nor other beasts. Their Emperors,
Dukes, and other of their nobles do abound with silk, gold, silver and
precious stones. Their victuals are all things that may be eaten....
They drink milk in great quantity, but especially mare&#8217;s milk
if they have it: they seathe milk also in water, making it so thin
that they may drink thereof. Everyone of them drinks off a cup full or
two in a morning, and sometime they eat nought else all the day long.
But in the evening each man hath a little flesh given him to eat, and
they drink the broth thereof. Howbeit in summer time, when they have
mare&#8217;s milk enough, they seldom eat flesh, unless perhaps it be
given them, or they take some beast or bird in hunting (p. 109).</p>

<p class="subhead">Chapter IX</p>

<p>But the Mongols ... prepared themselves to battle against the
Kythayans [men of Cathay or China].... This is the first time, when
the Emperor of the Kythayans being vanquished, Chinghiz Cham [Khan]
obtained the Empire. But some part of the country, because it lieth
within the sea, they could by no means conquer unto this day. The men
of Kythay are pagans, having a special kind of writing by themselves,
and (as it is reported) the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament ...
and they worship One God. They adore and reverence Christ Jesus Our
Lord, and believe the article of eternal life, but are not baptized.
They do also honourably esteem and reverence our Scriptures. They love
Christians and bestow much alms, and are a very courteous and gentle
people. They have no beards and they agree partly with the Mongols in
the disposition of their countenance. In all occupations which men
practise there are not better artificers in the whole world. Their
country is exceeding rich in corn, wine, golde, silke, and other
commodities (p. 115).</p>

<h3>RUBRUQUIS&#8217; ACCOUNT OF A JOURNEY FROM CONSTANTINOPLE INTO THE
CRIMEA: AND OF THE NOMAD TARTARS AND CHINESE</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1253-5. (Hakluyt Society. <cite>Carpini and
Rubruquis.</cite> Beazley).</p></div>

<p class="subhead">Chapter I</p>

<p>Then they put us to our choice whether we would have carts and
oxen, or pack horses to transport our carriages [i.e., luggage]. And
the merchants of Constantinople advised me not to take carts of the
citizens of Soldaia [Sudak, a Crimean port] but to buy covered carts
of mine own (such as the Russians carry their skins in) and to put all
our carriages, which I would daily take out, into them: because if I
should use horses, I must be constrained at every bait to take down my
carriages, and to lift them up again upon sundry horses&#8217; backs
and besides that, I should ride a more gentle pace by the oxen drawing
the carts. Wherefore, contenting myself with their evil counsel, I was
travelling into Sartach two months which I could have done in one, if
I had gone by horse. I brought with me from Constantinople (being by
the merchants advised so to do) pleasant fruits, muscadel wine, and
delicate bisket bread to present unto the governours of Soldaia, to the
end I might obtain free passage: because they look favourably upon no
man which commeth with an empty hand....</p>

<p>We took our journey therefore about the kalends of June, with four
covered carts of our own and with two other which we borrowed of them,
wherein we carried our bedding to rest upon in the night, and they
allowed us five horses to ride upon. For there were just five persons
in our company; namely, I myself, and my associate, friar Bartholomew
of Cremona, and Goset the bearer of these presents, the man of God
Turgemannus, and Nicholas my servant, whom I bought at Constantinople
with some part of the alms bestowed upon me. Moreover they allowed us
two men, which drave our carts and gave attendance unto our oxen and
horses. There are forty castles between Korsova and Soldaia every one
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
which have their proper languages: amongst whom there were many Goths,
who spake the Dutch tongue ... they repair thither out of all Russia
for salt.... The third day after we were departed out of Soldaia, we
found the Tartars. Among whom being entered, methought I was come into
a new world.</p>

<p class="subhead">Chapter II</p>

<p>They have in no place any settled city to abide in.... For in the
winter they descend into the warm regions southward. And in the summer
they ascend into the cold regions northward. In winter when snow lieth
upon the ground, they feed their cattle upon pastures without water,
because then they use snow instead of water. Their houses wherein they
sleep they ground upon a round foundation of wickers artificially
wrought and compacted together: the roof whereof consisteth in like
[sort] of wickers, meeting above into one little roundell out of which
roundell ascendeth upward a neck like unto a chimney, which they cover
with white felt.... The said felt on the neck of their house they do
garnish over with beautiful variety of pictures.... For they spend
all their coloured felt in painting vines, trees, birds and beasts
thereupon. The said houses they make so large that they contain thirty
foot in breadth. For measuring once the wheel ruts of one of their
carts, I found it to be 20 feet over; and when the house was upon the
cart, it stretched over the wheels on each side five feet at the least.
I told 22 oxen in one team, drawing a house upon a cart, eleven in one
order according to the breadth of the cart, and eleven more before
them: the axletree of the cart was of a huge bigness like unto the
mast of a ship. And a fellow stood in the door of the house, upon the
forestall of the cart, driving forth the oxen.... When they take down
their dwelling houses they turn always the door towards the south. One
woman will guide 20 or 30 carts at once, for their countries are very
plain and they bind the carts with camels or oxen one behind another.
And there sits a wench in the foremost cart driving the oxen, and all
the rest follow on a like pace. When they chance to come at any bad
passage they let them loose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44"
id="Page_44">[44]</a></span> and guide them over one by one: for they
go a slow pace, as fast as a lamb or an ox can walk....</p>

<p class="subhead">Chapter XXIII</p>

<p>Some days we had change of horses twice or thrice in a day.
Sometimes we travelled two or three days together, not finding any
people, and then we were constrained not to ride so fast. Of twenty
or thirty horses we had always the worst, because we were strangers.
For everyone took their choice of the best horses before us. They
provided me always of a strong horse, because I was very corpulent and
heavy: but whether he ambled a gentle pace or no, I durst not make any
question. Neither yet durst I complain, although he trotted full sore.
But everyone must be contented with his lot as it fell.</p>

<p class="subhead">Chapter XXIV</p>

<p>Of hunger and thirst, cold and weariness there was no end. For they
gave us no victuals but only in the evening. In the morning they used
to give us a little drink, or some sodden millet to sup off. In the
evening they bestowed flesh upon us ... and every man had a measured
quantity

of broth to drink.... In the beginning our guide highly disdained us,
and it was tedious unto him to conduct such base fellows. Afterward,
when he began to know us somewhat better he directed us on our way by
the courts of rich Moals [? Moghuls], and we were requested to pray
for them. Wherefore had I carried a good interpreter with me, I should
have had opportunity to have done much good.... And they marvelled
exceedingly that we would receive neither gold, nor silver, nor
precious and costly garments at their hand....</p>

<p class="subhead">Chapter XXVII</p>

<p>They begin to write at the top of their paper drawing their lines
right down: and so they read and multiply their lines from the left
hand to the right.... They burn their dead, according to the ancient
custom, and lay up the ashes on the top of a Pyramid....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45"

<p class="subhead">Chapter XXVIII (p. 234)</p>

<p>Beyond Muc is Great Cathaya, the inhabitants whereof (as I suppose)
were of old time called Seres. For from them are brought most excellent
stuffs of silk. And this people is called Seres of a certain town in
the same country. I was credibly informed that, in the said country,
there is one town having walls of silver, and bulwarks or towers of
gold. There be many provinces in that land, the greater part whereof
are not as yet subdued unto the Tartars.</p>

<h3>MARCO POLO</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(<cite>The Book of Ser Marco Polo, the Venetian</cite>, Col.
H. Yule. Edn. 1875)</p>

<p class="subhead">Rusticiano&#8217;s address (p. 1)</p>

<p>Great Princes, Emperors, and Kings, Dukes and Marquises, Counts,
Knights and Burgesses and people of all degrees who desire to get
knowledge of the various races of mankind, and of the diversities of
the sundry regions of the World, take this book and cause it to be read
to you....</p>

<p>For let me tell you that since our Lord God did mould with his
hands our first father, Adam, even until this day, never hath there
been Christian or Pagan, or Tartar or Indian or any man of any nation,
who in his own person hath had so much knowledge and experience of
the divers parts of the World and its Wonders as hath this Messer
Marco....</p>

<p>and I may tell you that in acquiring this knowledge he spent in
those various parts of the world good six and twenty years. Now
being thereafter an inmate of the Prison at Genoa, he caused Messer
Rusticiano of Pisa, who was in the said Prison likewise to reduce the
whole to writing; and this befell in the year 1298 from the birth of
Jesus.</p>

<p class="subhead">His Summary</p>

<p>It came to pass in the year of Christ 1260 ... that Messer Nicolas
Polo, the father of my lord Mark, and Messer Maffeo Polo, the brother
of Messer Nicolas, were at the city of Constantinople, whither they had
gone from Venice with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46"
id="Page_46">[46]</a></span> merchant&#8217;s wares. Now these two
... took counsel together to cross the Greater Sea (Black Sea) on a
venture of trade; so they laid in a store of jewels and set forth from
Constantinople, crossing the sea to Soldaia ... and travelled till
they came to the court of a certain Tartar Prince ... whose residences
were at Sara and at Bolgara [Sarai and Bolghar] and by reason of ...
war no one could travel ... on the road by which the Brothers had
come ... so the Brothers, finding that they could not retrace their
steps, determined to go forward ... and passing the River Tigris they
travelled across a desert which extended for 17 days journey and
wherein they found neither town nor village, falling in only with the
tents of Tartars occupied with their cattle at pasture (p. 9)....
They arrived at a very great and noble city called Bocara [Bokhara].
The city is the best in all Persia ... there came Envoys on their way
to the court of the Great Khan.... &#8220;In truth,&#8221; said the
Envoys, &#8220;the Great Khan hath never seen any Latins, and he hath
a great desire so to do. Wherefore if ye will keep us company to his
court, ye may depend upon it that he will be right glad to see you and
will treat you with great honour and liberality; whilst in our company
ye shall travel with perfect security, and need fear to be molested by
nobody!&#8221; So they set out and journeyed for a whole year, going
northward and north-eastward.... When the two brothers got to the Great
Khan at Karakoram, he received them with great honour ... asking them a
great number of questions. [They return with a message from him to the
Pope, and young Marco, aged 15, accompanies them back to China, learns
4 eastern languages, and is employed on embassies by the great Kublai
Khan for 17 years. They are then sent by sea via Java and Trebizond to
the Levant].</p>

<p class="subhead">Account of Kublai Khan</p>

<p>He is of a good stature, neither tall nor short, but of a middle
height. He has a becoming amount of flesh, and is very shapely in all
his limbs. His complexion is white and red, the eyes black and fine,
the nose well formed and well set on (p. 318).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47"
id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>I shall tell you of the great and wonderful magnificence of the
Great Khan now reigning, by name Kublay Khan; Khan being a title which
signifieth &#8220;The Great Lord of Lords&#8221; or Emperor. Now this
Kublai Khan is of the right Imperial lineage, being descended from
Chinghiz Khan, the first sovereign of all the Tartars ... (p. 324). He
came to the throne in the year of Christ 1256 ... up to the year of
Christ now running, to wit 1298, he hath reigned two and forty years,
and his age is about 85.... The Great Khan resides in the capital city
of Cathay, which is called Cambaluc. (Khan baligh, Khan&#8217;s city).
In that city stands his great Palace ... it is enclosed all round by a
great wall forming a square, each side of which is a mile in length.</p>

<p>This you may depend on, it is also very thick, and a good ten paces
in height, whitewashed and loopholed all round. At each angle of the
wall there is a very fine and rich palace in which the war-harness of
the Emperor is kept, such as bows and quivers, saddles and bridles,
and bowstrings and everything needful for an army. The great wall has
five gates on its southern face ... inside of this wall there is a
second. You must know that is the greatest Palace that ever was ...
hath no upper storey, but is all on the ground floor ... the roof is
very lofty, and the walls of the Palace are all with gold and silver.
They are also adorned with representations of dragons, beasts and
birds, knights and idols, and sundry other subjects. And on the ceiling
too you can see nothing but gold and silver and paintings. The Hall
of the Palace is so large that it could easily dine 6,000 people; and
it is quite a marvel to see how many rooms there are besides.... The
outside of the roof also is all coloured with vermilion and yellow and
green and blue and other hues, which are fixed with a varnish so fine
and exquisite that they shine <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48"
id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>like crystal ... seen for a great way round
(pp. 324, 325).</p>

THIRTEENTH CENTURY LONDON</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTORY NOTES</h3>

<p class="subhead">Mint and Coinage</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Compare</span> list of Saxon
mints under Athelstane with this account of the King&#8217;s mint,
in the eighteenth century. The history of coinage is illustrated by
notes of clipping; repeated re-coinage; advice of merchants on coinage
over-ridden, case of persecution, of laws for clipping, etc.</p>

<p>Compare also with fifteenth century extracts.</p>

<p class="subhead">Aliens and King&#8217;s Income</p>

<p>Great importance of aliens in trade and industry is constantly
appearing in London records. The king collects his customs by farming
them out to the Lombards; he makes an income by weighing, granting
charters, taking prisage, fines, etc.</p>

<p>(1269) The &#8220;hosting&#8221; of aliens, i.e. the rule that every
alien must lodge with an English host who will be answerable for him,
is practised. The special position of the Jews is well illustrated,
nominally under protection of king and Mayor they are yet attacked by
King and Pope as well as people.</p>

<p class="subhead">City Government</p>

<p>Strife is continual between the citizens and the royal officers for
control of the city. Its freedom dated from Henry I&#8217;s charter of
1100 (cf. Stubbs, <cite>Select Charters</cite>). In 1249 the citizens claim to be
peers of &#8220;the earls and barons of England.&#8221; The survival
of the Saxon practice of witness on oath is evidenced in 1267 by the
witness of &#8220;12 sworn men of the City&#8221; not swearing to fact
but to ancient usage.</p>

<p>The titles and duties of the king&#8217;s officers are illustrated;
the Treasurer, Constable, Warden, claiming dues for the King,
Sheriffs of London and Middlesex, Barons of Exchequer and other<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span> wardens
all holding by royal appointment. The persistence of the folkmote is
evidenced in 1260, when the oath of loyalty is taken, as in the time
of Richard I&#8217;s crusade. In 1267 a tax on movables is levied,
first done in 1207. The intervention of the citizens between Barons
and King in 1262 foreshadows their intervention in de Montfort&#8217;s
Parliament of 1265 and that of Edward I, 1295, indicates the influence
of the new class of burghers made wealthy by the wool trade. The
various activities of the City officers show the gradual organisation
of ordered life in a commune of this date; further illustrated
by the Mayor&#8217;s reliance on craft-gilds in 1262 against the
&#8220;aldermen or chief citizens,&#8221; the officers of the Merchant
Gild.</p>

<p>In connection with the Black Death it is noteworthy how frequent
famines were in the earlier part of the fourteenth century and how food
sales were regulated; the rules of the Court Leet in the sixteenth
century would, no doubt, be in practice at this earlier period in some
parts of England.</p>

<p class="subhead">Battle of Sluys</p>

<p>A good instance of fourteenth century naval warfare, the French make
no use of mobility but make conditions as near as possible to land
fighting; the English, however, use advantage of wind and are already
carrying heavier artillery than their opponents, an English naval
characteristic later.</p>

<p class="subhead">Fourteenth Century Prices</p>

<p>Lancaster was cousin to Edward II, and his rival for power; in
1314 he practically controlled the kingdom, but provoked the envy of
Pembroke and was captured at Boroughbridge in 1322 and executed. This
period of great royal princes rivalling the king, culminates in the
usurpation of Henry IV and the Wars of the Roses. The extract gives a
vivid picture of the various ranks in the household of such a lord. It
may be used to compare values and prices in this century with those
of the thirteenth century (see <cite>London Records</cite>) and with fifteenth
century wages.</p>

<h3>COINAGE</h3>

<h4>A.D. 1247</h4>

<p class="subhead2">(<cite>Chronicles of Old London</cite>, Edited by H. T.
Riley)</p>

<p>In the same year, Michael Tovy was again made Mayor, and by precept
of his lordship the King it was published that if any clipped penny or
halfpenny should be found offered for the purchase of anything, the
same should immediately be perforated. At this time, the money was
entirely made anew, that is to say, immediately after the Feast of All
Saints [November 1.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51"
id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<h4>A.D. 1257</h4>

<p>In this year, the King issued a new coinage, of golden pennies, each
of two sterlings [i.e., silver pennies] in weight, and of the purest
gold; and it was his will that such gold coin should pass current in
value for twenty sterlings.</p>

<p>This year, on the Sunday next after the Feast of All Saints the
Mayor and citizens appearing before his lordship the King at the
Exchequer in obedience to his precept, he put them to the question,
conjuring them by the fealty in which they were bound to him, that
they would certify him, according to their consciences, whether the
aforesaid coinage would be beneficial and for the common weal of his
kingdom, or not. Accordingly, holding counsel and conference thereon
among themselves, they appeared before the King and said, that through
that coinage the greatest detriment might accrue to his realm, and
more especially to the poor of his realm, the chattels of very many
of whom are not worth in value a single gold coin. And further they
said that through that coinage gold would be held of much lower value,
when that money should come to be dispersed in so many hands; a thing
that was already evident, seeing that sheet gold, which always used
to be worth ten marks, was then worth nine marks only, or even eight
(p. oz.). Whereupon after they had set forth many reasons why that
coinage would prove otherwise than beneficial, his lordship, the King
replied: &#8220;It is my will that this coinage shall pass current,
the penny for twenty sterlings, but that no one shall be compelled to
take it; and whosoever shall take it, shall be at liberty to exchange
it wherever he may please, without hindrance therein; and if he shall
think proper, he may come to our Exchange, and shall have for every
such golden penny nineteen pence and one halfpenny.&#8221;</p>

<h4>A.D. 1278</h4>

<p>In this year the exchange was made at the Tower of London, of the
new money, sterling, halfpenny and farthing, and Gregory de Rokesle,
Master of the Exchange throughout all England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52"
id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<h4>A.D. 1300</h4>

<p>... On the day of St. Stephen (Dec. 28), at the beginning of the
eight and twentieth year [of Edward I], the crocards and pollards
were proclaimed. (i.e., the crooked or polled, i.e. clipped coins
of inferior value. They generally passed for one penny, but by
proclamation their value was fixed at one halfpenny.) They were cried
down throughout England and continued current only until the Vigil of
Easter Day next ensuing: upon which Vigil it was forbidden that they
should pass current. This money came from Flanders and was current in
England throughout the land for six years, to the great damage of all
the realm.</p>

<h3>ALIENS</h3>

<h4>A.D. 1268</h4>

<p>... His lordship the King ... had granted unto Sir Edward his son,
to take custom of all things coming by sea into England and from
England going forth, and such custom had been leased unto certain
Italians upon yearly payment to Sir Edward of a farm of six thousand
marks; the said Italians exacted the same custom of the citizens
of London, and took sureties of them, in contravention of their
franchises.</p>

<p>Wherefore the citizens went to Sir Edward, and begged of him that
he would not allow such a yoke of servitude to be imposed upon them,
in contravention of the franchises by the Charters of his lordship the
King, his father, and of his predecessors, Kings of England, unto them
granted: whereupon Sir Edward, at their entreaty, granted unto them
acquittance of the custom aforesaid, giving them his letters patent
thereon. The citizens, however, made court to him, giving him 200
marks.</p>

<h4>A.D. 1269</h4>

<p>... according to the custom of the City, all merchant strangers
coming into London, were wont to be harboured, together with their
merchandize, in hostels belonging to the<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span> citizens; and their wares,
which are sold by the hundredweight, such as wax, alum and the like,
to be weighed by the balance of his lordship the King. Other wares
again, which are valued by the pound, such as pepper, ginger, brasil
(i.e., a kind of wood for making red dye), grains, and the like, used
to be weighed by various balances at the hosts&#8217; places, or else
by the basket of them, the buyer having upon every hundredweight four
pounds for the draught; the commodity being weighed with the pin
standing midway, the same as gold and silver are weighed. Afterwards
the Italians, the people of Quercy, and the merchants of Provence (who
at first however were but few in number), coming to the City with their
merchandize, transacted business in a similar manner; but in process of
time, when a great number of merchants from the parts aforesaid, who
were extremely rich, had brought into the City a very great quantity
of merchandize, in order that the amount of such wares might remain
unknown to the citizens, they declined to be harboured in the hostels
of the citizens, but built houses in the City, and abode therein by
themselves, housing there their goods. And then too, weighing by
balances of their own, they sold their wares contrary to the custom
of the City; and even went so far as themselves to weigh by their own
balances certain articles which were sold by the hundredweight, and
which ought to be weighed by the King&#8217;s balance; to the prejudice
of his lordship the King, and to the loss and subtraction of his pesage
[duty for weighing]; and this they did for many years.</p>

<p>Afterwards, when his lordship the King gave unto the citizens a
new Charter as to their liberties, in which it is set forth that
no merchant stranger shall buy or sell any wares that ought to be
weighed or troned, except by the beam and tron of his lordship the
King, under forfeiture of the whole of such wares&mdash;and this, too,
had been proclaimed throughout all the City&mdash;these merchants,
nevertheless, continued to weigh as they had previously done. But when
the King and his Council were given to understand this, his bailiffs,
in accordance with his command, took all the balances and weights of
the said merchants, and upon good sureties,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> attached the persons
themselves. Afterwards, in this year, ... the King summoned the said
merchants to appear before himself and his Council at Westminster; and
because they were convicted ... and because their balances and weights,
when examined in the King&#8217;s Exchange, were found, it is said, to
be untrue, they were adjudged to be amerced and committed to prison;
immediately upon which, being about twenty in number, they were taken
to the Tower and there imprisoned.</p>

<p>On the morrow, too, their balances and weights were burnt in
Westchepe; and such parts thereof as could not be consumed by fire,
were broken to pieces with iron hammers, and wholly destroyed....</p>

<p>Then the said merchants made fine to the King in the sum of one
thousand pounds sterling; and this under compulsion, as it were, they
being in dread of being thrust into a most noisome prison.</p>

<h4>A.D. 1270</h4>

<p>... in this year, about Easter last past, it was provided by the
common Council of his lordship the King, that cloths coming into
England from the parts beyond sea should contain at least 26 ells in
length, and an ell and a half in breadth, under forfeiture of the
whole piece of cloth. And at the same time, orders were given to the
merchants that, after the Fair of St. Botolph then next coming, they
should not bring any cloths into England, under the penalty aforesaid,
unless they should be of the said length and breadth, burels [coarse
cloths] of Normandy excepted.</p>

<p>In this year, the citizens of London took Queen Hithe, they paying a
yearly rent of fifty pounds to Earl Richard, and sixty shillings to the
Sick of St. Giles&#8217;s without London.</p>

<p>In this year, the Prior and Canons of St.
Bartholomew&#8217;s, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55"
id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>... set up a new tron, on the vigil of St.
Bartholomew, refusing to allow anyone to weigh except with that tron;
and this, in contravention of the liberties and customs of the City.
Wherefore the principal men of the City, together with their Mayor,
Peter Fitz-Alan and a multitude of the citizens, on the morrow went
to the Priory of St. Bartholomew, and advised the Prior and Canons of
that place to make amends for that act of presumption, and to desist
therefrom; whereupon they forthwith gave up the practice, and by the
Mayor and Sheriffs of London it was published that every man was to
sell, buy and weigh in that market, just as they previously had been
wont to do.</p>

<h3>JURISDICTION DISPUTED</h3>

<h4>1247</h4>

<p>In the same year ... a Justiciar sent by his lordship the King, came
to St. Martin&#8217;s le Grand, to hear the record which had been given
upon the plaint of Margery Vyel, ... in the previous year ...; as to
which judgment the said Margery had made complaint to his lordship the
King, and had found pledges to prove that the same was false.</p>

<p>Whereupon, the Mayor and citizens meeting there, the record
having been read through, and all the writs of his lordship the King
which the said Margery had obtained, having been read and heard, the
Justiciar said: &#8220;I do not say that this judgment is false, but
the process therein is faulty, as there is no mention made in this
record of summons of the opponents of the said Margery, and, seeing
that John Vyel, her husband, made a will, it did not pertain to your
Court to determine such a plea as this.&#8221; To which the citizens
made answer: &#8220;There was no necessity to summon those who had
possession of the property of the deceased, for they were always ready,
and proffered to stand trial at suit of the said Margery in our Court;
and besides, we were fully able to entertain such plea by assent of
the two parties, who did not at all claim or demand the Ecclesiastical
Court, and seeing that his lordship the King by his writ commanded us
to determine the same.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>At length, after much altercation ... the Justiciar said that they
must shew all this to the King and his Council, and so they withdrew.
Afterwards, however, and solely for this cause, his lordship the King
took the City into his hand, and by his writ entrusted it to the
custody of William de Haverille and Edward de Westminster, namely, on
the Vigil of St. Bartholomew (24 August); whereupon, the Mayor and
citizens went to the King at Wudestok, and shewed him that they had
done no wrong; but they could not regain his favour....</p>

<p>Afterwards, on the Sunday before the Nativity of St. Mary (8
September), the Mayor and Sheriffs, by leave of the King, received the
City into their hands, and a day was given them to make answer as to
the aforesaid judgment before the King and his Barons.</p>

<h4>A.D. 1248</h4>

<p>In this year, the citizens of London, at the request of his lordship
the King, not compelled, yet as though compelled, took their wares to
the Fair of Westminster, on Saint Edward&#8217;s Day, and also the
citizens of many cities of England, by precept of his lordship the
King, repaired thither with their wares; all of whom made a stay at
that fair of full fifteen days, all the shops and selds [large sheds]
of the merchants of London being closed in the meantime.</p>

<p>And on the morrow of St. Edward, the Mayor and citizens appeared
at Westminster, to make answer as to the judgment before mentioned
... his lordship the King requested them to permit the Abbot of
Westminster to enjoy the franchises which the King had granted him in
Middlesex, in exchange for other liberties which the citizens might of
right demand. To which the citizens made answer, that they could do
nothing as to such matter without the consent of the whole community.
The King, however, on learning this, as though moved to anger,
made them appear before him, and after much altercation had passed
as to the said judgment ... counsel being at last held before his
lordship the King between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57"
id="Page_57">[57]</a></span> Bishops and Barons, the Mayor and citizens
were acquitted and took their departure.</p>

<h4>A.D. 1249</h4>

<p>In the same year, ... the citizens recovered before the King, two
kinds of franchise, of which for many years they had been deprived, for
the King granted that the Jews, who before had been held to warranty by
writ of the Exchequer, should plead in future before the citizens as to
their tenements in London. He also granted that the Chirographers of
the Chest of the Jews [keepers of the bonds] should be tallaged like
other citizens.</p>

<p>In this year, on Sunday in Midlent, nearly all the men, as well as
women, of London having met together, in accordance with the precept of
his lordship the King in the Great Hall at Westminster, his lordship
the King assumed the Cross with the view of setting out in aid of the
Holy Land. It is also to be noted, that after his lordship the King had
repeatedly requested the citizens to grant to the Abbot of Westminster
the franchises which we have already mentioned in this record, in
this year, on the Wednesday, namely, in the week of Pentecost, there
was a day of love appointed at the demand of his lordship the King,
between the citizens and the Abbot; upon which day, the Mayor, and a
countless multitude of the citizens with him, came to the New Temple,
where the Abbot was, there being also present, William de Haverhill,
the Treasurer, Henry de Ba, Roger de Turkelby, John de Gatesdene,
Justiciars, and others who had been sent thither by the King. Upon
these desiring to hold a conference with the Mayor and Aldermen, the
whole of the populace opposed it, and would not allow them, without the
whole of the commons being present, to treat at all of the matter; all
of them exclaiming with one voice that in no point would they recede
from their wonted franchises, which, by Charters of his lordship the
King and his predecessors, they possessed.</p>

<p>Upon this, a day was given them by the Justiciars to appear
before his lordship the King at Wyndlesore, the Tuesday<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
following, namely; and solely for this reason the King took the City
into his hands, and delivered it to William the Treasurer, and to
Peter Blund, the Constable of the Tower, all the clerks and serjeants
of the Sheriffwick paying obedience to them. On the day appointed,
the Mayor and citizens appeared at Wyndlesore; when the King, wishing
to harass them, compelled them, through his Justiciars, to shew cause
why they had gainsaid the Charter which he had granted to the Abbot of
Westminster.</p>

<p>The citizens however made answer, that they had had no day named
for pleading there against the Abbot of Westminster, and that out of
the City of London they were not bound to plead; and that if they had
been bound to plead thereon, they ought not to receive any judgment as
to the same in the absence of their peers, the Earls, namely Barons of
England....</p>

<p>After this, consultations being held between the King and his
Council, the City was restored to the citizens, and day was given them
until the Translation of St. Edward (13 October).</p>

<h4>A.D. 1250</h4>

<p>... it was enacted by the citizens, that the Wardens of the Bridge,
from that day forward, should have, take or claim nothing from the
ships or property of citizens passing through the middle of the Bridge
[drawbridge]; whereas before they had been wont to take twelve pence
for every ship belonging to a citizen, the same as foreigners.</p>

<h4>A.D. 1253</h4>

<p>In this year, it was enacted by the community, that no one of the
franchise of the City should in future pay scavage [due paid for
right to display] for his beasts sold on the field of Smethefield, as
before they had been wont. In this year, about the season of Lent,
the Sheriffs of Middlesex, by precept of his lordship the King,
caused all wears to be destroyed that stood in the Thames towards the
west; and at this time many nets which were injurious, were burnt
in Westchep. Afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59"
id="Page_59">[59]</a></span> and before Pentecost, the Sheriffs of
London, seeing that the water of Thames pertains to London, by precept
of his lordship the King destroyed all the other wears from London to
the sea.</p>

<h4>A.D. 1254</h4>

<p>In this year Ralph Hardel was elected Mayor of London.... And
immediately after this, the Barons (of the Exchequer) shewed a writ of
his lordship the King, by which precept was given unto them that they
should take the City into the King&#8217;s hands, for non-observance
in the City of the assize of bread and ale. And although the citizens
ought not to be molested for such a default as this, but only the
Sheriffs, if convicted thereof; still the City was taken into the
King&#8217;s hands, and delivered into the custody of John de Gyseorz,
the said John being sworn before the Barons; after which the clerks
and all the serjeants of the Sheriffs, as also the Wardens of the
Gates, the Thames and the Gaol, were there sworn. And all this had been
discussed in the Parliament aforesaid, because the citizens, being
divided among themselves, would not appear there before Earl Richard,
as they had promised him, to put an end to a matter on which they had
frequently entreated him before, namely, the Exchange.</p>

<p>Afterwards the citizens waited upon the Earl to entreat his favour;
whereupon he named to them a day at London, saying that he would do
nothing therein without counsel of the King, to whom a moiety of the
issues of the Exchange belonged. After this, on the third day after
the Feast of St. Edmund the Archbishop, the citizens of Westminster
made fine to the said Earl before the Council of his lordship the King,
in a sum of 600 marks; whereupon all claims were remitted on account
of the Exchange, and the Mayor and Sheriffs were restored to their
bailiwicks.</p>

<p>(King Henry attempts to make the City answerable for a felon escaped
from Newgate).</p>

<p>To this the citizens made answer, that the custody of the Gaol does
not belong to them, but to the Sheriffs only. Whereupon answer was made
to them by the King, that as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60"
id="Page_60">[60]</a></span> they make the Sheriffs, they themselves
ought to be answerable for them. To this the citizens said, that they
do not make the Sheriffs, but only have to choose them, and present
them to the Barons of his lordship the King; and that such Sheriffs can
do nothing in respect of their office, before they have been admitted
at the Exchequer; that in no point ought they to be answerable for the
Sheriffs, save only as to the ferm due from the Sheriffwick, and only
then, when the Sheriffs themselves are not of sufficient means to pay
the ferm.</p>

<h3>EFFECTS OF BARONS&#8217; WAR UPON THE CITY</h3>

<h4>A.D. 1260</h4>

<p>The same year ... the King came to London, and afterwards, on the
Sunday before the Feast of St. Valentine, had the Folkmote summoned
at St. Paul&#8217;s Cross; whither he himself came.... The King also
commanded that all persons of the age of twelve years and upwards
should make oath before their Alderman, in every Ward, that they would
be faithful unto him, so long as he should live, and after his death,
to his heir; which was accordingly done. Then all the Gates of the City
were shut, night and day, by the King&#8217;s command, the Bridge Gate
and the Gates of Ludgate and Aldgate excepted, which were open by day
and well fortified with armed men.</p>

<h4>A.D. 1262</h4>

<p>In this year before Pentecost, the Barons who had given their assent
to the observance of the Ordinances and Statutes made at Oxford, sent
a certain letter to his lordship the King ... after this they sent a
letter to the citizens of London ... whether they would observe the
said Ordinances.... Upon receiving the message the citizens shewed
the same to his lordship the King ... and they further said that all
the community was willing to observe those Statutes which were to the
honour of God, in fealty to the King, and<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span> to the advantage of
the realm ... and further that it was their wish that no knights,
serjeants, aliens by birth, should be allowed to sojourn in the City;
for that it was through them that all the dissensions had arisen
between the King and his Barons. After this, by the King&#8217;s
command, certain of the citizens were sent to Dover with the
King&#8217;s Council, to treat for peace with the Barons....</p>

<p>At this season, and indeed before, all aliens, both knights and
serjeants, were dismissed from the City; who were afterwards placed
by Sir Edward in garrison at Wyndleshore. And at this time also the
citizens kept watch and ward, riding by night throughout the City with
horse and arms; though among them a countless multitude of persons on
foot obtruded themselves; some evil-minded among whom, under pretext
of searching for aliens, broke open many houses belonging to other
persons, and carried off such goods as were there to be found. To
restrain the evil designs of these persons, the watches on horseback
were therefore put an end to, and watch was kept by the respective
Wards, each person keeping himself well armed within his own Ward.</p>

<p>Afterwards, on the Sunday before the Feast of St. Margaret (July
20) the Barons came to London, and on the morrow the King and Queen
withdrew from the Tower to Westminster. At this time with the assent
of his lordship the King, Hugh le Despencer was made by the Barons
Justiciar of all England, and the Tower of London delivered into his
charge.</p>

<h4>A.D. 1262</h4>

<p>Be it here remarked, that this Mayor (Thomas Fitzthomas) during
the time of his mayoralty had so pampered the City populace, that,
stiling themselves the &#8220;Commons of the City,&#8221; they had
obtained the first voice in the City. For the Mayor, in doing all
that he had to do, acted and determined through them, and would say
to them, &#8220;Is it your will that so it shall be?&#8221; and then,
if they answered &#8220;Ya, ya,&#8221; so it was done. And on the
other hand, the Aldermen or chief citizens were little or not at
all consulted on such matter; but were in fact just as though they
had not existed. Through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62"
id="Page_62">[62]</a></span> this, that same populace became so elated
and so inflated with pride, that during the commotions in the realm ...
they formed themselves into covins, and leagued themselves together by
oath, by the hundred and by the thousand, under a sort of colour of
keeping the peace, whereas they themselves were manifestly disturbers
of the peace. For whereas the Barons were only fighting against those
who wished to break the aforesaid Statutes, and seized the property of
such, and that too by day, the others by night broke into the houses
of the people of Quercy and of other persons in the City, who were not
against the said Statutes, and by main force carried off the property
found in such houses, besides doing many other unlawful acts as well.
As to the Mayor, he censured these persons in but a lukewarm way.</p>

<p>Afterwards these same persons, like so many Justiciars Itinerant,
wished to remove all purprestures [encroachments], new and old,
observing no order of trial; and endeavoured to throw open lanes,
which, by writ of his lordship the King and with the sanction of the
Justiciars Itinerant, the community assenting thereto, had been stopped
up and rented to certain persons; so much so, in fact, that some of
them they opened, without judgment given, and in like manner did they
remove certain purprestures, and some of them after dinner; and this
they did, not only for the purpose of removing them, but for the
opportunity of carrying off the timber and other things there to be
found.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Mayor too, had all the populace of the City summoned, telling
them that the men of each craft must make such provisions as should be
to their own advantage, and he himself would have the same proclaimed
throughout the City and strictly observed.</p>

<p>Accordingly after this, from day to day, individuals of every craft
of themselves made new statutes and provisions, or rather what might
be stiled &#8220;abominations,&#8221; and that, solely for their own
advantage, and to the intolerable loss of all merchants coming to
London and visiting the fairs of England, and the exceeding injury of
all persons in the realm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63"
id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<h4>AWARD OF THE KING OF FRANCE MADE BETWEEN THE KING AND THE BARONS</h4>

<p>The Londoners, however, and the Barons of the Cinque Ports, and
nearly all the middle class of people throughout the kingdom of
England, who indeed had not joined in the reference to the king of
France, wholly declined his award.</p>

<p>Wherefore, the Londoners appointed one of their number, Thomas de
Piwelesdone by name, to be their Constable, and as Marshal, Stephen
Buckerel, at whose summons, upon hearing the great bell of St.
Paul&#8217;s, all the people were to sally forth, and not otherwise;
being prepared as well by night as by day, well armed, to follow
the standards of the said Constable and Marshal wheresoever they
might think proper to lead them. After this, Hugh le Despencer, the
Justiciar, who then had charge of the Tower, with a countless multitude
of Londoners, went forth from the City, following the standards of
the aforesaid Constable and Marshal, none of them knowing whither
they were going, or what they were to do. Being led however as far as
Ystleworthe, they there laid waste and ravaged with fire the manor of
the King of Almaine,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a
href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and plundered all
the property there found, and broke down and burned his mills and
fish preserves, observing no truce, at the very time that the said
Parliament [of Oxford, 1262] was in existence. And this was the
beginning of woes, and the source of that deadly war, through which so
many manors were committed to the flames, so many men, rich and poor,
were plundered, and so many thousands of persons lost their lives.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At this time, the Barons and Londoners entered into a league written
by instrument and by oath, all in fact of 12 years and upwards; to the
effect that they would stand together against all men, saving however
their fealty to their lord the King.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<h4>A.D. 1265</h4>

<p>Be it remarked, that at the time when the City submitted itself unto
the mercy of his lordship the King, many persons in the City who had
spontaneously sided with the Earl of Leicester, took to flight; having
committed depredations and many mischiefs within the City and without,
and, in the time of the aforesaid Mayor, styling themselves the
&#8220;Commons of the City,&#8221; having had the first voice there,
the principal men being little consulted in reference thereto.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Be it remarked, that many of the common people, on the day that the
aforesaid election took place, gainsayed the same, crying &#8220;Nay,
nay&#8221;, and saying, &#8220;We will have no one for Mayor, save
only Thomas Fitzthomas, and we desire that he be released from prison,
as well as his companions, who are at Wyndleshores.&#8221; Such base
exclamations did the fools of the vulgar classes give utterance to,
on the previous Monday, in the same Guildhall. Wherefore his lordship
the King, on hearing rumours to this effect, fearing an insurrection
of the populace against the principal men of the City, who maintained
their fealty towards him, sent to London Sir Roger de Leiburne; who on
the Saturday next ensuing, came into the Guildhall with a great retinue
of knights and serjeants, with arms beneath their clothes; whither a
countless multitude of the City had already resorted, and that without
summons. And the same Sir Roger gave orders, on behalf of his lordship
the King, that all who were suspected should be seized and put in
arrest, lest they might enter into some confederacy with the enemies
of his lordship the King. Wherefore on the same day there were taken
more than twenty persons, no one of the populace making any opposition
thereto.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The same year, on the second of the Ides of July (12 August) at
night the wife of Sir Edward was delivered of her firstborn son,
at Wyndleshores, on hearing news of which, the citizens of London
caused proclamation to be made in the City, that on the morrow the
whole community should celebrate the same by doing no handicraft, for
joyousness at the birth of the said child. Accordingly on that day all
selds and shops being closed, all the men and women, clergy as well as
lay, went on foot and horseback to Westminster, to give thanks unto
God for the birth of the child, and to offer prayers for its safety.
Also throughout the streets of the City there was dancing and singing
of carols for joy, as is the usual yearly custom upon the Feast of St.
John the Baptist (24 June). The name that was given to the child was
John.</p>

<h3>FOOD SUPPLIES AND REGULATIONS</h3>

<h4>ASSISE OF WINE: DISPUTED. A.D. 1256.</h4>

<p>In the same year, Henry de Ba (Bath) Justiciar, came to
the Guildhall of London, bringing to the Mayor and Sheriffs
a writ from his lordship the King; who thereupon summoned
before him all the vintners of the City. The Justiciar wishing
to amerce all these for breach of the assise of wine, the citizens
made answer, that the vintners who had broken the assise
ought, and are wont, solely to be amerced at the Common
Pleas of the Crown, and not before a Justiciar at the Tower.
To whom the Justiciar made answer ... that this will not
satisfy his lordship the King, for that it does not seem just or
right that they may break the assise for seven years or more
with impunity, and only once be amerced for so many offences.</p>

<p>To which reply was made, that his lordship the King is
both wont to and may whenever he pleases, upon election by
the citizens, appoint two wardens to keep that assise, in manner
as heretofore; ... that the same wardens, too, when any
one is convicted of breach of the assise, ought to sell the wine
found in the tun, in reference to which the breach has been
committed, and to produce the money at the Pleas of the
Crown holden before the Justiciars, the transgressor nevertheless
being there also amerced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<h4>METHODS OF WEIGHING</h4>

<h4>A.D. 1256</h4>

<p>It has usually been the custom, when wares which have to be sold
by balance, are weighed, for the draught of the balance to incline on
the wares side, the case of gold and silver excepted which are always
weighed with the pin standing midway, and inclining neither towards
the weight nor towards the gold or silver; and consequently that the
weigher who weighs in the City by the balance of his lordship the King,
is able, by reason of such draught, to give a greater weight to one
person than to another, through favour, maybe, or through fear, or
through a bribe passing between them, or perhaps inadvertence.</p>

<p>It was therefore provided and enacted on the Saturday after the
Feast of St. Nicholas (6 December) in the one and fortieth year of the
reign of King Henry, son of King John, that all wares which have to be
weighed by the King&#8217;s balances in the City, shall be weighed like
gold and silver, the draught in no degree inclining towards the wares;
and that in lieu of such draught, the vendor ought to give to the buyer
four pounds in every hundred.</p>

<h4>A.D. 1257.</h4>

<p>In this year there was a failure of the crops; upon which failure
a famine ensued, to such a degree that the people from the villages
resorted to the City for food; and there upon the famine waxing still
greater, many thousand persons perished; many thousands more too would
have died of hunger, had not corn just then arrived from Almaine. [The
German States.]</p>

<h4>KING&#8217;S PRISAGE. A.D. 1257</h4>

<p>After this, on the Nones (5) of August an edict was published in the
City, that no one of the King&#8217;s household, nor any other person
should take anything in the City, except at<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span> the will of the vendors;
saving however unto his lordship the King his rightful prisage of wine,
that is to say from every ship that owes full custom two tuns of wine
at the price of forty shillings. And further that if anyone should
presume to contravene the same and be convicted thereof, he should be
immediately imprisoned. After this no one of the King&#8217;s officers,
nor yet any of their people, took anything without soon after paying
the vendor for the same: this however lasted for a short time only.</p>

<h4>A.D. 1262</h4>

<p>In this year ... the Mayor and citizens of London shewed unto Sir
Philip Basset, Justiciar of England, and others of the Council of his
lordship the King at Westminster, that the Constable of the Tower in
contravention of their franchises, wished to arrest and seize vessels
in the Thames before the Tower, and take prisage of corn and other
things, before they had reached the wharf; further saying, that just
then he had caused a vessel belonging to Thomas de Basings, laden with
wheat, to be stopped before the Tower, and was for taking one hundred
quarters therefrom, at a price by the quarter, two pence less than it
would have sold for when brought ashore. To which the Constable made
answer, that this he was quite at liberty to do, in behalf of his
lordship the King; whereupon the citizens replied that attachments
on the Thames pertain solely to the Sheriffs of London, seeing that
the whole water of Thames belongs to the City from shore to shore, as
far as the Newe Were; (close to Yantlet creek) as has been repeatedly
shown....</p>

<p>They said also that his lordship the King takes no prisage of corn,
before the vessel has reached the wharf, and that then he is to have
the quarter of wheat at two pence less than it would sell for; and
this only for the support of his own household. Also that neither the
Constable nor any other person is to have prisage of corn, but that if
he wishes to buy anything, he must buy it in the market of the City,
like the citizens, and at the option of the vendor; and they entreated
his lordship the King, that he would preserve their liberties....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68"
id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<h4>LIQUID MEASURES. A.D. 1264</h4>

<p>In this year it was provided at the Hustings, on the morrow of All
Souls (2 November), that all measures by which wine, ale and other
liquors are sold, should be of the same dimensions, the mouth of the
gallon being ordered to measure four inches across (cf. 1273).</p>

<h4>FISHING REGULATIONS. A.D. 1269</h4>

<p>Be it remarked that in ancient times it had been enacted and
provided as to nets, used for fishing in the Thames, that in the
body of such nets the meshes should be woven of such a size that a
man&#8217;s thumb nail might be able wholly to pass through them; and
that if in any net there should be found a single mesh otherwise woven,
the whole of such net was to be condemned....</p>

<p>For which reason it was ... there were many nets seized and brought
to the Guildhall, and there by twelve sworn men of the City, who had no
share in the said nets, adjudged to be in contravention of the statutes
aforesaid. But as to this decision some of the citizens thought
differently; and in fact there were some who said, that that part only
ought to be burnt which was faulty and unfair, and that the other parts
which were good and lawful ought to be saved; while on the other hand,
the City, in meeting of its commons, pronounced that a net, a part of
which is bad, is bad all over....</p>

<p>... in accordance with the precedent that on another occasion such
nets had been wholly burnt the citizens agreed in common that these
should in the same manner be condemned; and accordingly so it was done
... all those nets, about twenty in number, were burnt in the middle of
Westchepe; so that nothing of them whatever was saved.</p>

<h4>A.D. 1269</h4>

<p>In this year the pillory that stood in Chepe was broken through the
negligence of the Bailiffs, and for a long time remained unrepaired;
wherefore, in the meantime no punishment<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span> was inflicted on the
bakers, who made their loaves just as they pleased; so much so, that
each of their loaves was deficient in one third of the weight that it
ought to weigh, according to the award that had been made upon the
assay of the Feast of St. Michael preceding; and this lasted for a
whole year and more.</p>

<p>In the same year, all the freemen of the kingdom of England, as
well of vills as of cities, and boroughs and elsewhere, gave unto his
lordship the King one twentieth part of all their moveable goods,
towards payment of his expenses on his expedition to the land of
Jerusalem. But afterwards Sir Edward undertook that expedition, on
behalf of his father and himself.</p>

<h4>A.D. 1270</h4>

<p>These Sheriffs, immediately after the Feast of St. Michael, had a
new pillory made, and erected it in the place where the old pillory had
previously stood....</p>

<h4>A.D. 1271</h4>

<p>Throughout all this year, no punishment was inflicted upon the
bakers; but they made loaves at their own will; so much so, that each
loaf was deficient in weight one third, or one fourth at least.</p>

<h3>MEASURES</h3>

<h4>A.D. 1273</h4>

<p>In this year, both before and after Pentecost, all the measures were
broken in pieces by the Mayor of the City, by which corn used to be
sold in the City, and new ones made of larger dimensions; each of which
measures was bound in the upper part by an iron hoop, fastened on with
iron nails, that so they might not at any time be falsified.</p>

<p>Each measure also, that is to say, each quarter, half quarter, and
bushel, was sealed with the Alderman&#8217;s seal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<h4>C. A.D. 1293</h4>

<p>Memorandum&mdash;that the gallon of Conduit water weighs ten pounds
four shillings (1s. 3/5oz.) by the ordinary weight.</p>

<p>Also the gallon of Thames water weighs ten pounds, sixteen pence, by
the same weight.</p>

<p>Also the grocers&#8217; pound of wax and of fruit is to weigh 25
shillings, the ounce 25 pence, and the quarter 6 shillings and 3
pence.</p>

<p>Be it remembered that the sterling (silver penny) must weigh 32
grains of corn in number, from the middle of the ear;</p>

<p>And to the quarter of an ounce go 160 grains in number.</p>

<p>And to the half ounce go 320 grains.</p>

<p>And to the whole ounce go 640 grains; the ounce, that is to say, of
twenty sterlings.</p>

<p>And to the quarter of the pound go 1,920 grains in number.</p>

<p>And to the half pound go 3,840 grains.</p>

<p>And to the pound of 20 shillings sterling go 7,680 grains in number,
divided into 12 ounces.</p>

<p>And the weight of two pounds, which amounts in number to 15,360
grains, makes the quarter of liquor.</p>

<p>And the weight of four pounds, which amounts in number to 30,720
grains, makes the pottle.</p>

<p>And the weight of eight pounds, which amounts in number to 61,440
grains, makes the gallon.</p>

<p>And the weight of thirty-two pounds, which amounts in number to
245,760 grains, makes the old half bushel.</p>

<p>And the weight of sixty-four pounds, which amounts in number to
491,520 grains, makes the bushel of wheat, of the ancient standard.</p>

<p>And the weight of 256 pounds, which amounts in number to 19,266,180
grains of wheat, makes the half quarter.</p>

<p>And the weight of 512 pounds sterling, which amounts in number of
grains of wheat to 3,932,160, makes the measure of one quarter of eight
bushels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71"
id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<h3>FAMINE</h3>

<h4>A.D. 1313</h4>

<p>In this year there were such great rains that the wheat failed,
and all other things as well, in August; and the rains lasted from
Pentecost to Easter.</p>

<p>In this year, upon the Day of St. James (25 July), before August,
there was one baker drawn upon the hurdle alone; and because another
baker did not have the same sentence carried out, the same day the
Mayor was reviled by the people....</p>

<h4>1315</h4>

<p>In this year there was a great famine, so that people without number
died of hunger; and there was also a great pestilence among the people.
The quarter of wheat was sold at Pentecost this year and after, at
thirty-eight and forty shillings; salt also, at forty shillings, and
two small onions for one penny.</p>

<h3>DISPUTED ELECTION OF MAYOR</h3>

<h4>A.D. 1271</h4>

<p>When the citizens of London, as the custom is, met together for
the election of Mayor in the Guildhall, ... and the Aldermen and more
discreet citizens would have chosen Philip le Tayllur, the mob of the
City, opposing such election and making a great tumult, cried aloud,
&#8220;Nay, nay, we will have no one for Mayor but Walter Hervi,&#8221;
who before was Mayor; and against the will of the rest, with all their
might, placed him in the seat of the Mayoralty. The Aldermen, however,
and many discreet men who sided with them, being unable to make head
against the vast multitude of a countless populace, immediately went
to his lordship the King and his Council at Westminster; and Walter
Herevy, taking with him the populace, proceeded thither in like manner,
promising them, as he before had promised, that he would preserve<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span> them,
one and all, throughout the whole time of his Mayoralty, exempt from
all tallages, exactions and tolls, and would keep the City acquitted
of all its debts, both as towards the Queen as towards all other
persons, out of the arrears in the rolls of the City Chamberlain
contained....</p>

<p>The populace, however, ... making a great tumult in the King&#8217;s
Hall&mdash;so much so, that the noise reached his lordship the King in
bed, to which he was confined by a severe illness&mdash;was continually
crying aloud, &#8220;We are the Commons of the City, and unto us
belongs the election of Mayor of the City, and our will distinctly is,
that Walter Herevy shall be Mayor, whom we have chosen.&#8221; But on
the other hand, the Aldermen shewed by many reasons, that unto them
belongs the election of Mayor, both because they, the Aldermen are the
heads, as it were, and the populace the limbs, as also because it is
the Aldermen who pronounce judgments in pleas moved within the City. Of
the populace on the other hand there are many who have neither lands,
rents, nor dwellings in the City, being sons of divers mothers, some of
them of servile station, and all of them caring little or nothing about
the City&#8217;s welfare.</p>

<h3>ACCUSATIONS AGAINST A MAYOR</h3>

<h4>A.D. 1271</h4>

<p>Firstly, this Walter had unrighteously attested that a certain
person had by writ of his lordship the King been admitted attorney in
the Court of his lordship the King as to Pleas of Land; whereas it was
afterwards ascertained that no writ thereupon had ever been issued from
the Chancery....</p>

<p>Also, in the time of his Mayoralty, he received a writ of his
lordship the King, commanding him to appear at Westminster on a certain
day there to shew by what right the citizens were to give seizin of the
Moor to Walter de Merton. Whereupon he, who was head of the City, and
ought to be the City&#8217;s defender, made default, and did not return
the writ; by reason whereof, the said citizens are in danger of losing
the said moor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73"
id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Also whereas he ... was bound to maintain and cause to be observed
all assises made by the Aldermen and discreet men of the City, and
proclaimed throughout the whole City, he allowed ale to be sold in his
Ward for threehalfpence the gallon, and confirmed such a sale setting
the seal of his Aldermanry to a certain unfair measure made against
the statutes of the City, which contained only the sixth part of a
gallon.</p>

<p>Also, whereas he ought not to take any part or receive any salary,
contrary to his oath he takes fees throughout all the City and receives
yearly a sum of money from the community of the fishmongers, upon the
understanding that he shall support them in their causes whether just
or unjust.</p>

<p>Also as to the letters patent which certain persons of the trades
made, ordaining statutes to their own proper advantage only and to the
loss of all the City and all the realm; to such letters while he was
Mayor, he set a part of the seal of the Community....</p>

<p>Also, whereas corn, wine and the like, when brought into the City
for sale, ought not to be taken back out of the City, according to the
law and custom of the City, he, taking a bribe, such for example, as
from one merchant a tun of wine, from another a pipe, and from another
twenty shillings, allowed more than a thousand tuns to be taken out of
the City, in contravention of his oath, and to the great loss of the
City.</p>

<h3>ANTI-SEMITE RIOTS</h3>

<h4>A.D. 1262</h4>

<p>In this year, just after the Feast of St. Martin (11th November)
about the time of Vespers, a certain Jew having wounded a Christian
in Colechurch Street, many Christians, indeed a countless multitude
of people, ran in pursuit of the Jew, and broke into many houses of
the Jews; not content with which, afterwards at nightfall they carried
off all the goods of the said Jews; and would have broken into many
more houses, and carried off the goods, had not the Mayor and Sheriffs
repaired to the spot and driven away those offenders by force of arms.
For which reason inquisition was made on the<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span> morrow and so from day to
day, by the Mayor and Sheriffs in the Guildhall....</p>

<h4>A.D. 1263</h4>

<p>Afterwards in the week before Palm Sunday, the Jewry in London was
destroyed, and all the property of the Jews carried off; as many of
them as were found being stripped naked, despoiled, and afterwards
murdered by night in sections, to the number that is to say of five
hundred. And as for those that survived, they were saved by the
Justiciars and the Mayor, having been sent to the Tower before the
slaughter took place; and then too the Chest of Chirographs was sent
to the Tower for safe custody. (See <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>
1249.)</p>

<h4>FLESH SOLD BY JEWS. A.D. 1273</h4>

<p>Certain discreet men of the City appeared before the Council of his
lordship the King at Westminster; whereupon members of the Council,
before certain Jews there present, questioned them thus, saying:
&#8220;It is notorious that the Jews kill with their own hands all
beasts and fowls whose flesh they eat. But some beasts they consider
of their law, and some not; the flesh of those which are of their law
they eat, and not the flesh of the others. What then do the Jews do
with the flesh of those that are not of their law? Is it lawful for the
Christians to buy and eat it?&#8221;</p>

<p>To which answer was made by the citizens, that if any Christian
should buy any such flesh of a Jew, he would be immediately expelled;
and that if he should be convicted thereof by the Sheriffs of the
City or by any other person, he would lose such flesh, and it would
be given to the lepers, or to the dogs, to eat; in addition to which
he would be heavily amerced by the Sheriffs. &#8220;But if it seems
to you that this punishment is too light a one, let your discreetness
make provision that such Christians shall be visited with a more severe
punishment.&#8221; Whereupon the members of the King&#8217;s Council
said: &#8220;We will not have such persons visited with any more severe
punishment, without his lordship the King;<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span> seeing that this matter
concerns the Jews, who belong to his lordship the King.&#8221;</p>

<h4>JEW CLIPPERS OF COINAGE. A.D. 1278</h4>

<p>In the same year, upon the Octaves of St. Martin (11th November)
which was a Friday, just before tierce (9 o&#8217;clock service), all
the Jews of England were seized by reason of the coin, which was vilely
clipped and falsified, and upon the Feast of St. Lucy (13th December)
after, all the goldsmiths of London, and all those of the Exchange and
many of the good folks in town were seized, by reason of the purchase
of bullion and the exchange of large coin for small, for which they had
been indicted by the Wards. And on the Monday next after the Tiffany
(Epiphany) the Justiciars sat at the Guildhall for delivery (gaol
delivery) thereon ... and by reason of such doing, three Christians and
293 Jews were drawn and hanged, for clipping the coin.</p>

<h4>A.D. 1284</h4>

<p>In this year all the Jews of England were taken and imprisoned; and
put to ransom....</p>

<h4>A.D. 1289</h4>

<p>And after this it was provided by the King and his Council, upon
prayer of the Pope, that all the Jews in England were sent into exile
between the Gule (1 Aug.) and the Feast of All Saints, under pain of
decapitation, if after such Feast any one of them should be found in
England.</p>

<h4>SWORDS FORBIDDEN. A.D. 1319</h4>

<p>In this year swords were forbidden, so that no one was to wear them;
by reason of which, many swords were taken and hung up beneath Ludgate,
within and without. At this time many of the people of the trades of
London were arrayed in livery, and a good time was about to begin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<h4>EDWARD II AND LONDON. A.D. 1321</h4>

<p>And soon after this the King caused a Charter of great service
[i.e., military service] to be made, and wished in every way that the
good people of London should have sealed it; but the people of the City
would not accede to it, for all that the King could do.</p>

<h4>PRIVATE EXPENSES OF EDWARD II</h4>

<p class="subhead2">(<cite>Antiquarian Repertory</cite>, Vol. II, p. 407. MS. in the possession of

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77"

<h4>BATTLE OF SLUYS. A.D. 1339.</h4>

<p class="subhead2">(<cite>Chronicles of London</cite>)</p>

<p>Upon the Friday morning, our King espied his enemies upon the sea,
and said, &#8220;Because our Lord Jesus Christ was put to death on a
Friday, we will not shed blood upon that day.&#8221;</p>

<p>The wind had then been in the East for the whole fortnight before
the King put to sea, but by the grace of Him Who is Almighty, the wind
shifted immediately to the West; so that, by the grace of God, the
King and his fleet had both wind and weather to their mind. And so
they sailed on until sunrise at break of day; when he saw his enemies
so strongly equipped, that it was a most dreadful thing to behold; for
the fleet of the ships of France was so strongly bound together with
massive chains, castles, bretasches, and bars.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding this, Sir Edward, our King, said to all those
who were around him in the fleet of England,&mdash;&#8220;Fair Lords
and brethren of mine, be nothing dismayed, but be of good cheer, and
he who for me shall begin the fight and shall combat with a right good
heart, shall have the benison of God Almighty; and every one shall
retain that which he shall gain.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so soon as our King had said this, all were of right eager
heart to avenge him of his enemies. And then our mariners hauled their
sails half mast high, and hauled up their anchors in manner as though
they intended to fly; and when the fleet of France beheld this, they
loosened themselves from their heavy chains to pursue us. And forthwith
our ships turned back upon them, and the melee began, to the sound of
trumpets, nakers, viols, tabors, and many other kinds of minstrelsy.
And then did our King, with three hundred ships, vigorously assail the
French with their five hundred great ships and galleys, and eagerly
did our people exert great diligence to give battle to the French. Our
archers and our arbalesters began to fire as densely as hail falls in
winter, and our engineers hurled so steadily, that the French had not
power to look or to hold up their heads. And in the meantime,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span> while
this assault lasted, our English people with a great force boarded
their galleys and fought with the French hand to hand, and threw them
out of their ships and galleys.</p>

<p>And always our King encouraged them to fight bravely with his
enemies, he himself being in the cog called &#8220;Thomas of
Winchelsea.&#8221; And at the hour of tierce there came to them a
ship of London, which belonged to William Haunsard, and it did much
good in the said battle. For the battle was so severe and so hardly
contested, that the assault lasted from noon all day and all night, and
the morrow until the hour of prime (six a.m.) and when the battle was
discontinued, no Frenchman remained alive, save only Spaudefisshe, who
took to flight with four and twenty ships and galleys.</p>

FIFTEENTH CENTURY LIFE</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTORY NOTES</h3>

<p class="subhead">The Tourney</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">This</span> is here shown to
be a sport, a trial of skill in which groups of knights encounter. The
more serious ordeal by battle or tournament is a duel often to the
death and so the rules for it are more strict and heavily guarded.</p>

<p>A good lesson on the courtesy of the late chivalric age may be drawn
from this and further illustrated from Froissart. Here as there, and in
Joinville, the care for horses may be seen.</p>

<p class="subhead">Wages and Coinage</p>

<p>These are chiefly useful for comparison with other periods,
especially those imposed in the Statute of Labourers. The powers of
the J.P. may be noted, also the status of the shepherd due to the
importance of wool for the new cloth manufacture.</p>

<p class="subhead">Safeguard of the Sea</p>

<p>This and the following extract are important as illustrating the
beginnings of a royal naval policy, the navy to be drawn from merchant
shipping and placed under military commanders. It is in accord with
the policy advocated in 1436 in the Libel of English Policy (see
Lipson, <cite>Economic History of England</cite>). They shew further the rise
of the direct influence of the wealthy wool and cloth merchants in
government.</p>

<p>The fleet captured by Wynynton is that of the Hansa League or
Easterling Merchants; the work of Henry IV and Henry V, in copying
Genoese models, enabled English ships for the first time to carry
more than one mast, and so increase both speed and capacity for
artillery. Henry VII and Henry VIII continued this policy but Elizabeth
economized, relying on their provision and on individual patriotic
effort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83"
id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p class="subhead">Paston Letters</p>

<p>The real meaning of the Wars of the Roses for the society of
the time, emerges from such pictures as those of the need for self
protection.</p>

<p class="subhead">Petition of the Commons</p>

<p>This demand of privilege shows how much the Parliament had gained
in power from the insecure position of Henry IV and Henry V&#8217;s
need for war supplies, while the merchants&#8217; wealth grew. It
suggests reasons for Henry VII&#8217;s determination to drain their
resources.</p>

<p class="subhead">Alnwick&#8217;s Visitations</p>

<p>It must be remembered that an enquiry such as this leads to the
airing of grievances, and so to a one-sided view of the monastic life;
also that by this time the original high standards of most orders were
beginning to droop. Care should be taken to avoid giving children a
biassed view on this subject.</p>

<p class="subhead">Enclosures</p>

<p>Under the common field system there had always existed closes,
or small fenced pieces of land attached to the owner&#8217;s
dwelling-house or farm. It was also a lawful practice in the thirteenth
century for lords or wealthy men to &#8220;approve,&#8221; i.e.,
enclose and cultivate portions of the land hitherto lying waste.</p>

<p>The enclosures of the sixteenth century differ from these. The
growth before 1400 of the wool industry for export, and after that
period for the English manufacture into cloth, raised the value of
sheep-farming, and combined with the shortage of labour to bring about
great sheep farms and a capitalistic system. Wealth was concentrated
in the hands of big merchants, nobles or corporations. In the late
sixteenth and early seventeenth century new methods of farming;
rotation of crops, including roots; dairying; great drainage schemes
led to the desire to escape from the unprogressive open field system;
by enclosing, dairy farms became possible, and the famous brands of
English cattle, sheep and horses could be developed.</p>

<p>The effect of these changes is noted by A. Young in his tours (see
p. 229, etc.).</p>

<p>Holinshed gives a short, clear account of the risings which<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span> were
brought about by rich or progressive owners enclosing their share of
the common fields, and often more than their share. The illustrations
from Cambridge documents give some of those details which alone enable
children to grasp these social changes.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>Item</i>: whoso hitteth the toyle or tilte thrice, shall

<p class="hang2"><i>Item</i>: whoso unhelms himself twice, shall have no

<p class="noindent p1"><i>How spears broken shall be allowed.</i></p>

<p class="hang2"><i>First</i>: whoso breaketh a spear between the saddle and

<p class="hang2"><i>Item</i>: whoso breaketh a spear so as he strike him
down or put him out of his saddle or disarm him in such wise as he
may not run the next course after, shall be allowed for three spears
broken.</p>

<p>Whereas your most noble grace hast most abundantly given unto four
maidens of your most honourable court, the castle called Loyal, to
dispose according to their pleasure; they have most liberally given the
guard and custody of the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85"
id="Page_85">[85]</a></span> unto a captain and with him fifteen
gentlemen ... they have undertaken the defence of the same ... to
defend and keep the same against all comers....</p>

<p>Item, in any days that this enterprize shall be done, to begin at
one of the clock at afternoon, and to continue until seven of the clock
at afternoon....</p>

<p>... The VI comers shall take a spear and a sword every of them
in like wise, the VI gentlemen putting themselves in range directly
against their fellows, every man his spear on his thigh and his sword
where it shall please him; and then at the sound of the trumpet to
charge and run together all at once everyman to his fellow that shall
stand against him, and so pass through.</p>

<p>Item, the course with the spears passed, everyman to take his sword
and do his best, only the foyne except, choosing his fellow by fortune
as it shall happen, and so to continue until the time that the king
shall command to rest.</p>

<p>Item, if any man of arms break his sword or lose it by any fortune
he may return to the scaffold where the heralds be and there receive
another and so enter into the tourney again. Also it shall not need
that every man confine to still in fighting with him whom he shall
first encounter, but if he will may also search to and fro taking his
advantage, and helping his fellow if need be, always defended that
no man lay hand on other but only with his sword to do his best nor
twain to set upon one alone unless it be in aiding of his fellow as
above....</p>

<p>Item, if any man be disarmed, he may withdraw himself if he will;
but once past the bars he may not come again into the tourney, for that
day. Also there shall no man have his servant within the bars with any
piece of harness, for no man shall be within the said bars but such as
shall be assigned by the king&#8217;s grace.</p>

<p>Item, who shall best demean himself at the same art of arms shall
have a sword garnished to the value of three hundred crowns or
under....</p>

<p>Item, if any man strike a horse with his spear, he shall be
put out of the tourney without any favour incontinent: and if any
slay an horse, he shall pay to the owner of the said horse<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span> an
hundred crowns in recompense; also it is not to be thought that any man
will strike an horse willingly: for if it do, it shall be to his great
dishonour.</p>

<h4>ORDER OF THE TOURNAMENT</h4>

<p>First, the quarrels and bills of the challenger and defendant
shall be pleaded in the court before the constable and marshall ...
the battle being appointed the constable shall assign them the day
and place, in sort that it be not within forty days after the battle
appointed ... awarding them how many weapons they shall have, i.e.,
glaive, long sword, short sword and dagger....</p>

<p>The king shall find the field to fight in ... the lists must be 60
pace long and 40 pace broad, in good order, so that the ground be hard,
stable and firm, and equally made, without great stones, the ground
flat; and that the lists be strongly barred about, with one door in the
east, another in the west, with good and strong bars 7 foot high or
more, that a horse cannot leap over them.</p>

<p>The day of the battle, the king shall be in a state upon a high
scaffold, and a place shall be made for the constable and marshall
at the foot of the stairs of the said scaffold, where they shall
sit....</p>

<p>When the Challenger cometh ... to the east gate of the lists in such
manner as he will fight with his armour and weapons as is appointed
by the court ... the constable and marshall shall go thither, and the
constable shall ask him what man he is that is come, armed to the
door of the lists? What is his name? And wherefore he is come? And
the challenger shall answer.... Then the constable opening the umbrel
of his helmet, and perceiving him to be the same man which is the
challenger, shall cause the door of the lists to be opened, and suffer
him to enter with his said armour, weapons, victuals, and other lowable
necessaries about him and also his council with him; and then he shall
bring him before the king and to his estate [station] where he shall
attend until the defendant be come. In the like sort shall be done to
the defendant; but that he shall enter in at the west door of the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span> lists
... the which thing being done, the constable and marshall shall view
the spears of the said challenger and defendant and shall cause them
to be cut and sharpened of equal measure.... [Both parties being made
to swear to their truth and honesty] ... the constable shall cause
them to clasp their hands together and to lay their left hands upon
the Book.... The oaths being ended and every of them led to his place,
their counsellers and friends being taken away from them ... the
constable shall command the marshall to make proclamation at the four
corners of the lists in manner and form following:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oies, oies, oies, we charge and command you in the behalf
of the King, the Constable and Marshall, that no man whether of great
or small estate ... be so hardie from henceforth to approach the
lists by four feet nor to speak one word, to make any countenance,
sign, likelihood or noise whereby any of the parties ... may take
advantage of each other, upon peril to lose their life and goods at
the king&#8217;s pleasure. That done the constable and marshall shall
cause the lists to be voided of all manner of persons except their
lieutenants and two knights one for the constable and one for the
marshall ... but the two lieutenants ... ought to have in their hands
either of them, a spear without iron, for to part them if the king
would cause them to stay in their fighting, whether it be to rest, or
otherwise howsoer it be ... and the parties being ready to fight as is
said, the constable shall by commandment of the King say with a loud
voice: Let them go and rest awhile; Let them go again and rest awhile;
Let them go and do their indevoir in God&#8217;s name.&#8221;</p>

<h3>PETITION FOR THE COINAGE OF HALFPENCE AND
FARTHINGS, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1444</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(Rol. Parl. V. 23 Hen. VI)</p>

<p>To the right worshipful and discreet Commons in this present
Parlement assembled;</p>

<p>Please it unto your said great and high discretions to consider the
great hurt that the poor Commons of this noble realm of England have
and suffer at this time for default of Halfpennies and Farthings of
silver; insomuch that men travelling over countries, for part of their
expenses of necessity must dispart our sovereign Lord&#8217;s coin,
that is to wit, a penny in two pieces, or else forgo all the same penny
for the payment of an halfpenny; and also the poor common retailers of
victuals, and of other needful things, for default of such coinage of
halfpennies and farthings oftentimes may not sell their said victuals
and things, and many of our said sovereign Lord&#8217;s poor liege
people which would buy such victuals or other small things necessary,
may not buy them for default of halfpence and farthings not had,
neither on the party buyer, nor on the party seller: which scarcity
and wanting of halfpence and farthings hath fall, and daily yet doth,
because that for their great weight and their fineness of alloy, they
be tried and molten, and put into other use, unto the increase of
winning of them that so do....</p>

<p>... enact ... that every pound weight of the Tower ... which
be now of the number of 30/-from this time forth, to be of the
number of 33/-, no fineness abated of the alloy ... moreover that
halfpennies and farthings run not, only in payment of great sums
among the people, without other money among; that is to say that no
man be bound to receive in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90"
id="Page_90">[90]</a></span> payment but after the quantity and
rate, in every 20/-of grotes, half grotes and pence, twelve pence in
halfpence and farthings and no more; and yet, [even] that by the will
and consent of him that shall receive the payment; and this ordinance
endure unto the next Parlement; provided also that no white money, as
grote, halfgrote, penny, halfpenny, nor farthings, be broken nor molten
for the cause above said, on pain of forfeiture to the king, the double
value of as much as is so molten or broken; considering furthermore
that by this means, plenty of halfpennies and farthings shall be had in
short time through this said realm, and the people greatly eased, and

<h3>FOR THE SAFEGUARD OF THE SEA</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(Petition of the Commons, 1442. 20th Henry VI Rot.
Parl. V, 59)</p>

<p>Prayen the Commons, that it please the King, our sovereign Lord, for
the safe keeping of the sea, to ordain and authorise by the authority
of this Parlement ...</p>

<p>Forasmuch as it is thought by all the Commons of this land, that
it is necessary the sea to be kept, there must purveyance be made for
certain ships defensably in manner and form following:</p>

<p>First it is thought that least purveyance that can be made for the
worship of the King our Sovereign Lord, and welfare and defence of
this realm of England is for to have upon the sea continually, for the
seasons of the year from Candlemas to Martinmas 8 ships with forstages,
the which ships it is thought must have one with another, each of them
150 men, sum (1200) men.</p>

<p>Item, every great ship must have attending upon him a barge and a
balinger, and every barge must have 24 men, sum 146 men.</p>

<p>Item, the 8 balingers must have in each of them 40 men, sum 320 men.
There must be awaiting and attendant upon<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span> them 4 Spynes, in each
spyne 25 men, sum 100 men; sum of the men 260 men, every man taking 11
shillings by the month, amounteth in the month &pound;226.</p>

<p>[Follows a list of &#8220;where the ships are to be had,&#8221;
Bristol, Hull, Dartmouth, Newcastle, etc. each contributing certain
vessels named].</p>

<p>Item, it is thought there should be chosen and named, eight Knights,
and worthy Squires of the West, South and of the North, so that no
countrie should be dispesid (sic) [despised]; and thereof the King our
Sovereign Lord chose such one as him liketh to be a chief Captain; and
other seven as the King liketh of the said eight, for to attend the
said Captain; so that every great ship have a Captain within board.</p>

<p>Item, it is to remember that the King will give them in charge,
by his officers to them sent, that all these said ships stuffed and
arrayed, make their first assemble in the Cuambre ... there to obey
such rule and governance, as by their Captain and under captain shall
to them be ordained and there muster of every ship to be seen by such
persons as the King will depute thereto by his commission.</p>

<p>Item, there such proclamation and ordinance to be made and
established amongst and in the said Navy, that none ship or ships harm
nor hurt none other ship of our friends; where through any trouble or
breaking of Peace might fall between the King our Sovereign Lord, and
other of his Friends.</p>

<p>Item, it is thought necessary, that if any ship or ships be taken as
enemies, when the goods in the said ship be brought into any port of
this land; that the goods nor the ships be not disperbled nor divided,
unto the time that it be duly known, whether it be enemies&#8217; goods
or friends&#8217; goods; foreseen always that the press be made within
the six weeks after the landing or havening of said ship or ships and
goods so taken....</p>

<p>Item, it is thought that the goods and ships that may be taken by
them, in the sea of our enemies, shall be departed in the form after
serving; that is to say, the masters of the ships, quartermasters,
shipmen and soldiers shall have half of the ships and goods so taken,
and other half of the ship and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92"
id="Page_92">[92]</a></span> goods shall be departed in three, of which
the owners of the ships, barges, balingers and spynaces shall have two
parts, and the chief Captain and under captains the third part; the
chief captain shall have double that one of the under captains shall
have.</p>

<h3>CAPTURE OF FRENCH AND HANSARD SHIPPING,</h3>

<p class="subhead2"><i>A.D.</i> 1449</p>

<p class="subhead2">(<cite>Paston Letters</cite>, Vol. I, p. 84)</p>

<p>Part of Robert Wynyngtone&#8217;s report of his service to the king
&#8220;for the cleansing of the sea, and rebuking of the robbers and
pirates thereof, which daily do all the noisance they can.&#8221;</p>

<p>First I send you word, that when we went to sea, we took two ships
of Brest coming out of Flanders; and then after, there is made a great
arming in Britanny to meet with me and my fellowships, that is to say,
the great ship of Brest, the great ship of the Morlaix, the great ship
of Vannes, with other viij ships, barges and balingers to the number of
iij mli [thousand men;] and so we lay in the sea to meet with them.</p>

<p>And then we met with a fleet of a hundred great ships of Prussia,
Lubeck, Campe, Rastocke, Holland, Zealand and Flanders, between
Guernsey and Portland; and then I came aboard the Admiral and bade
them strike in the King&#8217;s name of England, and they bade me
skite [? strike] in the King&#8217;s name of England; and then I and
my fellowships said, but he will strike down the sail, that I would
oversail him, by the grace of God, an God will send me wind and
weather; and they bade me do my worst, by cause I had so few ships and
so small that they scorned with me. And as God would, on Friday last
was, we had a good wind, and then we armed to the number of ii.m. men
in my fellowship, and made us ready for to oversail them; and then they
launched a boat and set up a standard of truce, and come and spake with
me. And there they were yielded all the hundred ships to go with me
in what port that me lust and my fellows; but they fought with<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span> me the
day before and shot at us a j.m. guns, and quarrel out of number,
and have slain many of my fellowships, and maimed also. Wherefore me
thinketh that they have forfeit both ships and goods at our sovereign
lord the King will ... and so I have brought them all the hundred
ships, within Wight, in spite of them all ... for I dare well say that
I have here at this time all the chief ships, of Dutchland [Germany],
Holland, Zealand and Flanders, and now it were time for to treat for a
final peace as for that parte.</p>

<h4>LETTER TO PASTON FROM HIS WIFE, A.D. 1449</h4>

<p class="subhead2">(<cite>Paston Letters</cite>, Vol. I, p. 82).</p>

<p class="noindent">Right worshipful husband,</p>

<p>I recommend me to you and pray you to get some cross bows and
windacs to bind them with, and quarrels; for our houses here be so low
that there may no man shoot out with no long bow, though we had never
so much need.</p>

<p>I suppose ye should have such things of Sir John Falstaff, if ye
would send to him; and also I would ye should get ij or iij short
pollaxes to keep within doors, and as many jacks, an ye may.</p>

<p>Partridge [one of Molyns&#8217; men] and his fellowship are sore
afraid that ye would enter again upon them, and they have made great
ordinance within the house, as it is told me. They have made bars to
bar the doors crosswise, and they have made wickets on every quarter
of the house to shoot out at, both with bows and with hand guns; and
the holes that be made for hand guns, they be scarce knee high from
the plancher [floor], and of such holes be made five. There can no man
shoot out at them with no hand bows.</p>

<p>I pray you that you will vouch save to do buy for me 1 lb. of
almonds and 1 lb. of sugar, and that ye will do buy some frieze to
make of your child his gowns; ye shall have best cheap and best choice
of Hayes wife as it is told me. And that ye would buy a yard of broad
cloth of black for an hood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94"

there is neither good cloth nor good frieze in this town. As for the

in all your matters.</p>

<h4>PETITION OF JOHN PASTON, ESQ.</h4>

<p class="subhead2">(<cite>Paston Letters</cite>, Vol. I, pp. 106-8)</p>

<p>To the King, our Sovereign Lord, and to the right wise and discreet
Lords, assembled in this present Parliament.</p>

<p>Beseecheth meekly your humble liegeman, John Paston, that where [as]
he and other ... have be peaceably possessed of the manor of Gresham,
within the county of Norfolk xx year and more, till the xxij day of
February, the year of your noble reign xxvi, that Robert Hungerford,
Knight, the Lord Molyns, entered in to the said manor ... the said
Lord sent to the mansion a riotous people, to the number of a thousand
persons ... arrayed in manner of war, with cuirasse, briganders, jacks,
salettes, glaives, bowes, arrows, pavyse (shields) pans with fire
burning therein, long cromes (hooks) to draw down houses, ladders,
pikes, with which they mined down the walls, and long trees with which
they broke up gates and doors, and so came into the said mansion, the
wife of your beseecher being at that time therein, and xlj persons with
her; the which persons they drove out of the said mansion, and mined
down the wall of the chamber wherein the wife of your said beseecher
was, and bare her out at the gates, and cut asunder the posts of the
houses and let them fall, and broke up all the chambers and coffers
within the said mansion, and rifled, and in manner of robbery bare
away all the stuffe, array, and money that your said beseecher and his
servants had there, unto the value of ccli ... saying openly that if
they might have found there your said beseecher and one John Damme,
which is of council with him, and divers others of the servants of
your said beseecher, they should have died. And yet [i.e. still]
divers of the said misdoers and riotous people unknown, contrary to
your laws, daily keep the said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95"
id="Page_95">[95]</a></span> manor with force, and lie in wait....
And also they compel poor tenants of the said manor, now within their
danger, against their will, to take feigned plaints in the courts of
the hundred there against the ... servants of your said beseecher,
who dare not appear to answer for fear of bodily harm, nor can get no
copies of the said plaints, to remedy them by the law, because he that
keepeth the said courts is of covyn with the said misdoers and was one
of the said risers....</p>

<p>Please it your highness, ... to purvey ... that your said beseecher
may be restored to the said goods and chattels thus riotously taken
away ... and that the said Lord Molynes and his servants be set in such
a rule, that your said beseecher, his friends, tenants and servants may
be sure and safe from hurt of their persons, and peaceably occupy their
lands and tenements under your laws without oppression or unrightful
vexation of any of them; and that the said risers and causers thereof
may be punished, that other may eschew to make any such rising in this
your land of peace in time coming. And he shall pray to God for you.</p>

<h3>CONDITION OF RELIGIOUS HOUSES</h3>

<h4>VISITATION OF BARDNEY</h4>

<p class="subhead2">(<cite>Alnwick&#8217;s Visitations of Religious
Houses</cite>, Vol. II, 1436-1449. Ed., A. Hamilton Thompson. Lincoln Record
Society)</p>

<p>In the year <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1437 in the chapter
house of the monastery of Bardney, of the Order of St. Benet, of the
diocese of Lincoln, these appeared before ... William ... bishop of
Lincoln ... brother John Waynflete, abbot of the same monastery and the
monks of the same place ... to undergo with lowliness the visitation of
the said reverend father....</p>

<p>Brother John Waynflete, the abbot, being examined says that they are
sixteen in number ... also he says that there are three establishments
in the monastery, to wit the abbot&#8217;s hall, the infirmary and the
frater; and sometimes the monks that do stay in the infirmary take
their meals not together but separately, to wit, one by himself, and
another by himself and a third by himself, and send their broken meat
into the town whither they will, and so the alms are wholly wasted.</p>

<p>Also he says that whatsoever guests come down to the monastery are
entertained in the guestmaster&#8217;s quarters, and not, as is the
usual custom, in the abbot&#8217;s hall.</p>

<p>Also he says that long and many watchings are kept at night in
the guest-house in the infirmary, at which beer from the frater is
consumed, and this by monks who spend their time in such offences
against discipline and will not give them up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97"
id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Also he says that all day long they sit in the frater drinking and
spending their time in messes and drinkings as though it were a public
tavern, and to these they bring in secular folk.</p>

<p>Also he says that the monks too often make expeditions into the town
of Bardney, where for their ease they haunt the taverns to the great
scandal of the monastery....</p>

<p>Also he says that the church, manors, granges and tenements
belonging to the monastery are much dilapidated and stand in need of
large repairs. Also he says that the monastery is many ways in debt, as
is apparent in the roll delivered to my lord.</p>

<p>Also he says that there is a sore division and discord among almost
all of the convent who are confederate together and in conspiracy one
with another against Thomas Bartone....</p>

<p>Also he says that the baker, the brewer, the porter, the smith and
the lime-burner receive corrodies severally of a large amount [and] do
eat almost daily of the abbot&#8217;s victuals.</p>

<p>Also he says that they who abide in the frater have each his
separate dish and they in the infirmary do eat by two and two, and
every day in the frater they will have at least three sorts of fish.</p>

<p>Also he says that women have too free and often access to the
cloister precincts and most especially to the infirmary [where there
is] eating, drinking and chattering between the monks and the same
women to the great expense and scandal [of the monastery].</p>

<p>Also he says that in the conventual church the monks almost of
custom do chatter with women during divine service [in a very ...]
manner, by reason whereof the monastery is very evil spoken of.</p>

<p>Also he says that each monk receives for his clothing year by year
forty shillings in divers parcels.</p>

<p class="p2">Brother John Rose, deacon, says that a young layman who dwells with
the abbot did most foully browbeat and scold this deponent, and it is
notorious [that] this youth, by name Taylboys, is upheld by the abbot
against the young monks.</p>

<p>Also he says ... that the chantries of Partney and Skandleley and
the others are not served.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98"
id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Also he says as above concerning the scanty supply of victuals for
the monks in the frater and infirmary, insomuch that after their meals
nothing is left for the sustenance of their serving men or for the alms
and this is Bartone&#8217;s default.</p>

<p>Also he says that Bartone is every night in the infirmary without
lawful cause.</p>

<p>Also he says that the injunctions made by the last my lord of
Lincoln in his visitation are not observed in aught, nor are they shown
publicly in the Chapterhouse.</p>

<p>Brother Richard Anderby says that Bartone makes too much haste in
singing the psalms and in other [parts of the service], causing discord
among them when they chant.</p>

<p>Also the same Bartone is past bearing among the brethren, and all
that he has he wastes in meat and drink and presents, that he may win
to himself for his support the influence of layfolk.</p>

<p>Also he speaks of the unwary and improvident sale of manors.</p>

<h4>CATESBY PRIORY</h4>

<p>Sister Juliane Wolfe says that there should be two lights burning in
the upper church and quire in time of divine service (p. 47).</p>

<p>Also she says that the prioress does not shew the account of her
administrations to the Sisters.</p>

<p>Also she says that the prioress has pawned the jewels of the
house....</p>

<p>Also she says that the prioress did threaten that, if the nuns
disclosed aught in the visitation, they should pay for it in prison.</p>

<p class="p2">Also Isabel Wavere, the prioress&#8217; mother, rules
almost the whole house together with Joan Colworthe, the kinswoman of a
certain priest, and these two do carry all the keys of the offices.</p>

<p>Also when guests come to the house, the prioress sends out the young
nuns to make their beds, the which is a scandal to the house and a
perilous thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99"
id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Also the prioress does not give the nuns satisfaction in the matter
of raiment and money for victuals: and she says that touching the
premises the prioress is in the nuns&#8217; debt for three-quarters of
a year.</p>

<p>Also the buildings and tenements both within and without the priory
are dilapidated, and many have fallen to the ground because of default
in repairs.</p>

<p>Dame Isabel Benet says that when the prioress is enraged against any
of the nuns, she calls them whores and pulls them by the hair, even in
quire....</p>

<p>The prioress denies the article of cruelty as regards calling them
whores and beggars; she denies also the violent laying of hands upon
the nuns.</p>

<p>As to not having rendered an account, she confesses it, and for the
reason that she has not a clerk who can write.</p>

<p>As to the burden of debt she refers herself to the account now to be
rendered.</p>

<p>As to the neglection in repairing the sheep-folds, she refers
herself to the visible evidence.</p>

<p>As to pawning the cup, she says that the same was done with the
consent of the convent for the payment of tithes....</p>

<p>As to the disclosures on the last visitation and the reproaching of
them that made them and the whipping, she denies the article....</p>

<p>As to her mother and Joan Coleworthe, she denies the article.</p>

<p>As to the bedmaking and the other tasks she denies the article.</p>

<p>As to withholding victuals and raiment from the nuns, she confesses
it in part.</p>

<p>As to the dilapidation of the outer tenements, she says that they
are partly in repair and partly not.</p>

<p>As to the sowing of discord, she says that she might have done this,
she is not certain....</p>

<p>She has the morrow for clearing herself, of [the articles] she has
denied, with four of her sisters, and to receive penance for those she
has confessed. At the which term she brought forward no compurgators;
... she was pronounced to be convicted....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100"
id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>My lord ordained that there be two [nuns] receivers, to receive and
to pay out [the money to be kept in a chest] under three locks, and
that all live in common, leaving off their separate households, and
that these things do begin at Michaelmas next. And all were warned to
remove all secular folk from the dorter on this side the morrow of the
Assumption. And all were warned under pain of excommunication that none
do reproach another by reason of her disclosures. And the prioress was
warned to [shut] and open the doors of the church and cloister at the
due times, and to keep the keys with her by night in the dorter.</p>

<p class="p2">Dames Isabel Benet and Agnes Halesley, nuns of Catesby,
will not obey or hearken to the injunctions of the lord bishop,
and especially that concerning giving up their [private] chambers,
asserting that they are not subject to the same.</p>

<p>Also the said dame Isabel on Monday last past did pass the night
with the Austin friars at Northampton, and did dance and play the lute
with them on the same place until midnight, and on the night following
she passed the night with the friars preachers at Northampton, luting
and dancing in like manner.</p>

<h3>SIXTEENTH CENTURY ENCLOSURES, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>
1549</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(Holinshed, <cite>Chronicle of England</cite>, III, p. 156)</p>

<p>So it was, that the King&#8217;s Majesty, by the advice of his
uncle, the Lord Protector, and other of the Council, thought good to
set forth a proclamation against enclosures, and taking in of fields
and commons that were accustomed to lie open, for the behoof of the
inhabitants dwelling near to the same, who had grievously complained of
gentlemen and others for taking from them the use of those fields and
commons, and had enclosed them into parks and several pasture for their
private commodities and pleasures, to the great hindrance and undoing
many a poor man.</p>

<p>This proclamation tending to the benefit and relief of the poor,
appointed that such as had enclosed those commons, should upon a
pain by a day assigned lay them open again.<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span> But how well soever the
setters forth of this proclamation meant, thinking hereby peradventure
to appease the grudge of the people that found themselves grieved
with such enclosures; yet verily it turned not to the wished effect,
but rather ministered occasion of a foul and dangerous disorder. For
whereas there were few that obeyed the commandment, the unadvised
people presuming upon their proclamation, thinking they should be borne
out by them that had set it forth, rashly without order took upon them
to redress the matter: and assembling themselves in unlawful wise,
chose to them captains and leaders, brake open the enclosures, cast
down ditches, killed up the deer which they found in parks, spoiled and
made havoc after the manner of an open rebellion. First they began to
play these parts in Somersetshire, Buckinghamshire, Northamptonshire,
Kent, Essex, and Lincolnshire.</p>

<p>In Somersetshire they brake up certain parks of Sir William Herbert,
and the Lord Sturton: but Sir William Herbert assembling a power
together by the King&#8217;s commission, slew and executed many of
these rebellious people. In other places also by the good diligence and
police used by the council, the rebels were appeased and quieted.</p>

<p>But shortly after, the commons of Devonshire and Cornwall rose by
way of rebellion, demanding not only to have enclosures laid open, and
parks disparked, but also through the instigations and pricking forward
of certain popish priests, ceased not by all sinister and subtle means,
first under God&#8217;s Name and the King&#8217;s, and under the colour
of religion, to persuade the people to assemble in routs to choose
captains to guide them and finally to burst out into open rebellion.</p>

<h3>GRIEVANCES OF CAMBRIDGE MEN. (EXAMPLES)</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(Cooper, <cite>Annals of Cambridge</cite>, Vol. II, p. 38)</p>

<p>Inprimis, we find that there be IV Almshouses decayed in Jesus Lane,

of the common and enclosed with a muddle wall at the end<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span> of
Jesus Lane, for the which the incorporation of the town is recompensed,
but not the whole inhabitants of the town which find themselves
injured.</p>

<p>Item: we find that Andrew Lambes close is croft land and ought to
lie open with the field at Lammas as common.</p>

<p>Item: we find that Mr. Hynde unlawfully doth bring into Cambridge
field a flock of sheep to the number of VI or VII hundred, to the
undoing of the farmers and great hindrance of all the inhabitants of
Cambridge.</p>

<p>Item: we find that Trinity College hath enclosed a common lane which
was a common course both for cart, horse and man, leading to the river,
unto a common green, and no recompense made therefore.</p>

<p>Item: we find that Mr. Muryell hath plowed up certain balks and cart
ways in the field.</p>

down a bridge, stopped the water, drowned the commons and so enter upon
Cambridge common.</p>

<p>Item: we find that Mr. Kymbalde hath walled and ditched upon the
highway in Barnwell, whereby the said way is much straitened.</p>

<p>Mem.: of a common balk through a pasture ground adjoining next to
Rutland&#8217;s house in Little St. Mary&#8217;s now inhabited by R.
Tomlynson, which balk should be a way to go to Thomas leys and so forth
on balks to Jesus Green, etc., which pasture is now purchased by the
town, etc.</p>

EXPLORATION</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTORY NOTES</h3>

<p class="subhead">Voyages of Columbus</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">These</span> accounts were
written by Columbus himself, and may be amplified very much by
reference to the originals in the Hakluyt Society&#8217;s volume.
Another account of the fourth voyage written by one of Columbus&#8217;
men, Diago Mendez, is of special value. The accounts are here placed
in their chronological order, but the passage on voyage three really
relates to the whole series, and might with advantage be used as
introductory. The Memorial on the second voyage is a very long official
document, from which only a few fragments have been given in order to
show the relations between Columbus and the sovereigns, and how from
the first the Spanish Indies were under their direct personal control.
Isabella had forewarded the discovery, and the new regions remained the
property of the House of Castille rather than national provinces.</p>

<p class="subhead">New Light on Drake</p>

<p>The Spanish reports have especial value in creating an impartial
view of Drake&#8217;s feats; the detailed personal character of the
reports makes them exactly suitable for children. Zarate&#8217;s
evidence that Drake carried the Queen&#8217;s commission conflicts with
the usually accepted statements, but appears irrefutable evidence.</p>

<p class="p2 noindent">Letter to Sanchez, Treasurer.</p>

<p>The entire absence of resistance should be remarked, and the merely
formal nature of the acquisition of rights.</p>

<p>It was, of course, the treasures of Cathay (see <cite>Medi&aelig;val
Voyages</cite>, p. 37), inaccessible by the old Eastern routes since the
Ottoman Turks seized the Levant and Constantinople, which<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
formed the original motive of exploration of a west or north-west
route.</p>

<p>The inhabitants are still in the Stone Age, but have elements of
religion and live peacefully and in comfort until attacked. The closing
paragraph gives the main motives of the voyage as treasure, luxuries,
and naval supply, but also indicates the genuinely religious zeal which
must be reckoned with in all Portuguese and Spanish exploration (see
also voyages three, four).</p>

<p class="p2 noindent">Memorial of Second Voyage.</p>

<p>The strongly-worded approval of the rulers was not carried into
practical effect (see voyage four). Fonseca was constituted the royal
agent for the whole intercourse with the New World.</p>

<p class="p2 noindent">Third Voyage.</p>

<p>Columbus&#8217;s reference to &#8220;trustworthy and wise
historians&#8221; seems to indicate that more was known of the New
World than has been supposed, unless he is referring to records of the
East. The progressive temper of the friars carries on the traditions
of Rubruquis and Carpini, and may be used to balance the idea that the
church was always reactionary and conservative.</p>

<p class="p2 noindent">Fourth Voyage.</p>

<p>Chiefly valuable for detail of the hardships and dangers
encountered, and to illustrate the character and human relations of
Columbus, and corroborate points made above.</p>

<h3>COLUMBUS</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(<cite>Select Letters of Christopher Columbus</cite>, Ed., R. H. Major;
Hakluyt Society, 1847)</p>

<p class="hanging">LETTER TO LORD RAPHAEL SANCHEZ, TREASURER TO THEIR
MOST INVINCIBLE MAJESTIES, FERDINAND AND ISABELLA, KING AND QUEEN OF
SPAIN (p. I).</p>

<p>... Thirty-three days after my departure from Cadiz I reached the
Indian Sea, where I discovered many islands, thickly peopled, of
which I took possession without resistance<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span> in the name of our
most illustrious Monarch, by public proclamation and with unfurled
banners. To the first of these islands I gave the name of Our Blessed
Saviour [San Salvador].... As soon as we arrived at ... Juana [Nth.
Caico] I proceeded along its coast a short distance westwards, and
found it to be so large and apparently without termination, that I
could not suppose it to be an island, but the continental province of
Cathay....</p>

<p>At length after proceeding a great way and finding that nothing new
presented itself, and that the line of coast was leading us northwards
(which I wished to avoid because it was winter) and it was my intention
to move southwards and because the winds were contrary, I resolved not
to attempt any further progress but rather to turn back.</p>

<p>... All these islands are very beautiful and distinguished by a
diversity of scenery; they are filled with a great variety of trees
of immense height, and which I believe to retain their foliage in all
seasons; for when I saw them they were as verdant and luxuriant as
they usually are in Spain in the month of May&mdash;some of them were
blossoming, some bearing fruit&mdash;yet the islands are not so thickly
wooded as to be impassable.... The nightingale and various birds were
singing in countless numbers, and that in November, the month in
which I arrived there.... There are besides, seven or eight kinds of
palm-trees ... the pines also are very handsome, and there are very
extensive fields and meadows, a variety of birds, different kinds of
honey, and many sorts of metals, but no iron....</p>

<p>The inhabitants of both sexes ... go always as they were born, with
the exception of some of the women, who use the coverings of a leaf or
small bough, or an apron of cotton which they prepare for that purpose.
None of them are possessed of any iron, neither have they weapons
... because they are timid and full of fear. They carry, however, in
lieu of arms, canes dried in the sun, on the ends of which they fix
heads of dried wood, sharpened to a point, and even these they dare
not use habitually ... and have fled in such haste at the approach
of our men, that the fathers forsook their children and the children
their fathers.... I gave to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109"
id="Page_109">[109]</a></span> all I approached whatever articles I had
about me, such as cloth and many other things, but they are naturally
timid and fearful ... they are very simple and honest and exceedingly
liberal with all they have ... they also give objects of great value
for trifles ... a sailor received for a leather strap, gold worth three
golden nobles ... thus they bartered like idiots, cotton and gold for
fragments of bows, glasses, bottles and jars; which I forbade as being
unjust....</p>

<p>They practise no kind of idolatry, but have a firm belief that all
strength and power, and indeed all good things, are in Heaven, and that
I had descended from thence with these ships and sailors, and under
this impression was I received after they had thrown aside their fears.
Nor are they slow or stupid but of very clear understanding....</p>

<p>On my arrival I had taken some Indians by force from the first
island that I came to, in order that they might learn our language and
communicate to us what they knew respecting the country; which plan
succeeded excellently, and was a great advantage to us, for in a short
time, either by gestures and signs or by words, we were enabled to
understand each other. These men are still travelling with me. At any
new place ... crying out ... to the other Indians, &#8220;Come, come
and look upon beings of a celestial race,&#8221; upon which both men
and women, children and adults, young men and old, when they got rid of
the fear they at first entertained, would come out in throngs, crowding
the roads to see us, some bringing food, others drink, with astonishing
affection and kindness. Each of these islands has a great number of
canoes, built of solid wood, narrow and not unlike our double banked
boats in length and shape, but swifter in their motion: they steer them
only by the oar.... (pp. 9, 10).</p>

<p>I ordered a fortress to be built there [Espanola] which must by this
time be completed, in which I left as many men as I thought necessary,
with all sorts of arms and enough provisions for more than a year.</p>

<p>... I did not find, as some of us had expected, any cannibals
amongst them, but on the contrary, men of great deference and kindness.
Neither are they black like the Ethiopians: their hair is smooth
and straight.... I saw no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110"
id="Page_110">[110]</a></span> cannibals, nor did I hear of any, except
in a certain island called Chari (? Carib).</p>

<p>Finally ... I promise, that with a little assistance afforded me by
our most invincible sovereigns, I will procure them as much gold as
they need, as great a quantity of spices, of cotton and of mastic, and
as many men for the service of the navy as their Majesties may require.
I promise also rhubarb and other sorts of drugs.... (p. 15).</p>

<p>But these great and marvellous results are not to be attributed to
any merit of mine, but to the Holy Christian faith, and to the piety
and religion of our sovereigns.... Let processions be made and sacred
feasts be held, and the temples be adorned with festive boughs....
Farewell.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap mr05">Christopher Columbus,</span><br />

Admiral of the Fleet of the Ocean.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 14th March.</p>

<h4 class="p2">MEMORIAL OF THE SECOND VOYAGE WITH COMMENTS THEREUPON
OF FERDINAND AND ISABELLA</h4>

<p>... We have found upon the sea-shore ... so many indications of
various spices, as naturally to suggest the hope of the best results
for the future. The same holds good with respect to the gold mines;
for two parties ... found ... a great number of rivers whose sands
contained this precious metal in such quantities that each man took up
a sample of it in his hand....</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent"><i>Their Highnesses return thanks to God for all
that is here recorded, and regard as a very signal service all
that the Admiral has already done, and is yet doing ...</i> (<i>pp. 70,
71</i>).</p></div>

<p>We are very certain, as the fact has shown, that wheat and grapes
will grow very well in this country. We must however, wait for the
fruit.... There are also sugar-canes, of which the small quantity that
we have planted has succeeded very well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111"
id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Since the land is so fertile, it is desirable to sow as much as
possible: and Don Juan de Fonseca has been desired to send over
immediately everything requisite for that purpose.... (pp. 77, 78).</p>

<h4>LETTER ABOUT THE THIRD VOYAGE</h4>

<p>This enterprise to the Indies [i.e., the original discovery] ...
those who heard of it looked upon it as impossible, for they fixed all
their hopes on the favours of fortune, and pinned their faith solely
upon chance. I gave to the subject six or seven years of great anxiety,
explaining ... how great service might be done to Our Lord, by this
undertaking, in promulgating his Sacred Name and most holy faith among
so many nations.... It was also requisite to refer to the temporal
prosperity which was foretold in the writings of so many trustworthy
and wise historians, who related that great riches were to be found in
these parts.... (p. 104).</p>

<p>In this your Highnesses exhibited the noble spirit which has
always been manifested by you on every subject; for all others who
had thought of the matter or heard it spoken of, unanimously treated
it with contempt, with the exception of two friars [a Franciscan and
a Dominican, afterwards Archbishop of Seville] who always remained
constant in their belief of its practicability.</p>

<h4>LETTER RELATING TO FOURTH VOYAGE</h4>

<p>... I pushed on for Terra Firma, in spite of the wind and a fearful
contrary current, against which I contended for sixty days, and during
that time made only seventy leagues (p. 171) ... other tempests have
been experienced but never of so long a duration or so fearful as this:
many whom we looked upon as brave men, on several occasions showed
considerable trepidation, but the distress of my son who was with me
grieved me to the soul and the more when I considered his tender age
for he was but thirteen years old, and he enduring so much toil for
so long a time. The Lord however gave him strength even to enable him
to encourage the rest, and he worked as if<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span> he had been eighty years
at sea, and all this was a consolation to me.</p>

<p>I myself had fallen sick and was many times at the point of death,
but from a little cabin that I had caused to be constructed on deck
I directed our course. My brother was in the ship that was in the
worst condition and the most exposed to danger; and my grief on this
account was the greater that I brought him with me against his will (p.
172).</p>

<p>Such is my fate, that the twenty years of service through which I
have passed with so much toil and danger, have profited me nothing, and
at this very day I do not possess a roof in Castille that I can call my
own; if I wish to eat or sleep, I have nowhere to go but to the inn or
tavern, and most times lack wherewith to pay the bill. Another anxiety
wrung my very heartstrings, which was the thought of my son Diege, whom
I had left an orphan in Spain, and stripped of the honour and property
which were due to him on my account.... (p. 173).</p>

<p>I stopped to repair my vessels and take in provisions, as well as
to afford relaxation to the men, who had become very weak ... two
Indians conducted me to Carambaru, where the people (who go naked) wear
golden mirrors round their necks.... They named to me many places on
the sea-coast where there were both gold and mines. The last that they
mentioned was Veragua, nine days&#8217; journey across the country
westward: they tell me there is a great quantity of gold, and that the
inhabitants wear coral ornaments on their heads, and very large coral
bracelets and anklets, with which article also they adorn and inlay
their seats, boxes and tables. They also said that the women there wore
necklaces hanging down to their shoulders (p. 175).... I had taken
possession of land belonging to Quibian [a native chief]. When he saw
what we did and found the traffic [in gold] increasing, he resolved
upon burning the houses, and putting us all to death; but his project
did not succeed for we took him prisoner, together with his wives, his
children and his servants ... the Indians collected themselves together
and made an attack upon the boats, and at length massacred the men.
My brother and all the rest of our people were in a ship which<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
remained inside [the river mouth, which had silted up]. I was alone
outside upon that dangerous coast, suffering from a severe fever and
worn with fatigue. All hope of escape was gone and I toiled up to the
highest part of the ship, and with a quivering voice and fast-falling
tears, I called upon your Highnesses&#8217; war-captains from each
point of the compass to come to my succour, but there was no reply.
[Columbus sleeps and sees a vision in which he is upbraided for want of
faith] (p. 184).</p>

<p>I collected the men who were on land.... I departed in the name of
the Holy Trinity, on Easter night, with the ships rotten, worn out and
eaten into holes [by the teredo].... I then had only two left.... I
was without boats or provisions, and in this condition I had to cross
seven thousand miles of sea; or as an alternative to die on the passage
with my son, my brother and so many of my people.... I send this letter
by means of and by the hands of Indians; it will be a miracle if it
reaches its destination (pp. 186, 189).</p>

<h3>NEW LIGHT ON DRAKE</h3>

<p class="hanging p2">DEPOSITION BY NUNO DA SILVA AS TO HOW HE WAS MADE
PRISONER BY ENGLISH PIRATES ON HIS VOYAGE FROM OPORTO TO BRAZIL (p.
301).</p>

<p class="subhead2">(<cite>Conquest of New Spain</cite>, Hakluyt Society
Publications, Series II, Vol. 24.)</p>

<p>&#8220;This Englishman calls himself Francis Drake and is a man aged
38. He may be two years more or less. He is low in stature, thickset
and very robust. He has a fine countenance, is ruddy of complexion
and has a fair beard. He has the mark of an arrow wound in his right
cheek which is not apparent if one does not look with especial care.
In one leg he has the ball of an arquebuse that was shot at him in
the Indies. He is [a great mariner] the son and relative of seamen,
and particularly of John Hawkins in whose company he was for a long
time.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p class="hanging p2">AN ABRIDGEMENT OF THE RELATION AND PROOFS MADE
AGAINST SIR FRANCIS DRAKE, KNIGHT, TOUCHING HIS DOINGS IN THE SOUTH SEA
BEYOND THE STRAIT OF MAGALANUS (p. 414).</p>

<p>It is informed the said Francis Drake went forth with 5 ships well
appointed and in them 400 men of war, having for pilot a Portingall
named Amador de Silva.</p>

<p>The said Drake came by Cape Verde and coasting the straits of Brazil
arrived at the mouth of the Strait of Magalanus where there is a very
good port named St. Julian, in the which they tarried wintering 2
months because of the great north winds which were contrary.</p>

<p>At the end of which time the 5 ships went out of the said port and
sailing in the Strait they had a tempest so vehement that 2 of the said
ships perished and they received the men into 3 remaining ships which
with 3 pinaces which they towed at their poops issued out of the Strait
into the South Sea in 44 degrees of altitude and sailing towards the
Sea, with a storm were 40 days in the Sea at dryte [? drift] and so the
two ships did separate themselves and the said Drake remained alone
which could never afterward see them.</p>

<p>It was understood that they went to the Malluccos and it was agreed
between them that they should meet in 30&frac12; degrees, which is the
Cape St. Francis.</p>

<p>From thence Drake came to the port of St. Iago from Chile and
entered into the ship of lycentiat Torres called &#8220;Capitana&#8221;
which was surging there from the which he took 14m Pezos of gold and
1800 botazes of wine and some other things.</p>

<p>From thence he entered into the town and robbed the ornaments and
bells of the church and broke down the doors of the cellars and brake
the vessels of wine, and carrying with him the ship which he had
spoiled, arrived in the port of Arica where a ship of Philippe Dorse
[Corco] was out of which he took 34 wedges of silver and burned one
other ship that was there of one Mr. Benito.</p>

<p>From the port they went forth in a pinnace with the two ships
that they had robbed and they arrived in the sight of<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span> the
port of Chile in Arequipa where there were laden in a ship of Bernal
Bueno 500 wedges of His Majesty which the said Drake would have robbed,
had not the men that were aboard by advice they had before, unladen and
hided the same a-land.</p>

<p>From thence they went forth following their voyage and being in the
high sea, took out of the two ships which they carried with them the
apparel and other things they had need of and so left them.</p>

<p>And the 13th of February they arrived in the port of Callao of the
City of Los Reys and entered into it and 3 hours after evening the said
Drake and company went out in a pinnace to a ship of Michell Angell
wherein he found nothing.</p>

<p>At the same time, there arrived a ship of Alonzo Rodriguez Baptista
which came from the firm land laden with marchandizes which presently
they took and robbed, hurting the said Alonzo and others that would
have defended themselves.</p>

<p>There were other ships in that port to the which the said Drake and
company went and cut their cables, because they should not follow and
then departed carrying with them the said merchant&#8217;s ship.</p>

<p>The news being known to the Viceroy he commanded to arm two ships
with a number of men that should go to pursue the ship of the said
Drake which was within sight, which two ships went forth the very same
day and came again the next day following, being not able to overtake
him, bringing with them the merchant&#8217;s ship of the said Alonzo
which the said Drake left behind him.</p>

<p>This Francis Drake went forth of the port of Callao and sailing
alongst the coast arrived at the port of Paita where he took a boat
arrived there with marchandizes, of the which he took those he thought
best, and carried with him the pilot with whom he came along the
coast enquiring of the ship of St. John de Anton, which was coming
from Panama, the which he overtook 150 leagues from the said place,
the first of March, and robbed all the treasure being therein. The
day before it was understood that he had robbed another small ship
which was coming from Guayaquill with eighteen thousand Pezos of
gold and silver, and great quantity of tackling and other things of
provision for the journey to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116"
id="Page_116">[116]</a></span> the Phillypinas and Valiano, the which
the royal audience had caused to be bought for the said effect.</p>

<p>All these things were done until the 24th of April in the year
1580.</p>

<p class="hanging p2">LETTER FROM DON FRANCISCO DE ZARATE TO DON MARTIN
ENRIQUEZ, VICEROY OF NEW SPAIN (p. 201)</p>

<p class="right"><span class="mr2">Realejo, Nicaragua,</span><br />
16th of April, 1579.</p>

<p>I sailed out of the port of Acapulce on 23rd of March, and navigated
until Saturday, 4th of April, on which date, half an hour before dawn,
we saw, by moonlight, a ship very close to ours. Our steersman shouted
that she was to get out of the way and not come alongside of us. To
this they made no answer pretending to be asleep. The steersman then
shouted louder, asking them where their ship hailed from. They answered
&#8220;from Peru&#8221; and that she was &#8220;of Miguel Angel,&#8221;
which is the name of a well-known captain of that route.</p>

<p>The spokesman on the ship was a Spaniard, whose name I will tell
Your Excellency further on.</p>

<p>The ship of the adversary carried her bark at her prow as though she
were being towed. Suddenly, in a moment, she crossed our poop, ordering
us &#8220;to strike sail&#8221; and shooting seven or eight arquebuse
shots at us.</p>

<p>We thought this as much of a joke as it afterwards turned out to be
serious.</p>

<p>On our part there was no resistance, nor had we more than six of
our men awake on the whole boat, so they entered our ship with as
little risk to themselves as though they were our friends. They did
no personal harm to anyone, beyond seizing the swords and keys of the
passengers. Having informed themselves who were on board ship, they
ordered me to go in their boat to where their general was&mdash;a fact
that I was glad of, as it appeared to me that it gave me more time in
which to recommend myself to God. But in a very short time we arrived
where he was, on a very good galleon, as well mounted with artillery as
any I have seen in my life.</p>

<p>I found him promenading on deck, and, on approaching<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span> him,
I kissed his hands. He received me with a show of kindness, and took
me to his cabin where he bade me be seated and said: &#8220;I am a
friend of those who tell me the truth, but with those who do not I get
out of humour. Therefore you must tell me (for this is the best road
to my favour): How much silver and gold does your ship carry?&#8221; I
said to him, &#8220;None.&#8221; He repeated his question, I answered,
&#8220;None, only some small plates that I use and some cups&mdash;that
is all that is in her.&#8221; ... We talked for a good while before it
was time to dine. He ordered me to sit next to him and began to give
me food from his own plate, telling me not to grieve, that my life and
property were safe. I kissed his hands for this.</p>

<p>He asked me if I knew where there was water to be had about here,
adding that he needed nothing else, and that as soon as he found some
he would give me leave to continue my journey....</p>

<p>On the following day, which was Sunday, he dressed and decked
himself very finely, and had his galleon decorated with all its
flags and banners.... He had entered the port of Callao de Lima and
cut the cables of all the ships that were in port. As the wind was
from the land they all went out to sea, where he had time to sack
them at his will. Before he proceeded to do the same to ours he said
to me: &#8220;Let one of your pages come with me to show me your
apparel.&#8221; He went from his galleon at about nine in the morning
and remained until towards dusk, examining everything contained in the
bales and chests. Of that which belonged to me he took but little.
Indeed he was quite courteous about it. Certain trifles of mine having
taken his fancy, he had them brought to his ship and gave me, in
exchange for them, a falcheon and a small brazier of silver, and I can
assure Your Excellency that he lost nothing by the bargain. On his
return to his vessel he asked me to pardon him for taking the trifles,
but that they were for his wife. He said that I could depart the next
morning when the breeze would rise, for which I gave him thanks....
He left Colchero [a Spanish pilot] with me, and after this set sail.
I understand that he carries three thousand bars of silver, and<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
twelve or fifteen chests of pieces of eight, and a great quantity of
gold. He is going straight to his country, and I believe that no vessel
that went after him could possibly overtake him. He has an intense
desire to return to his own country.</p>

<p>This general of the Englishmen is a nephew of John Hawkins, and is
the same who, about five years ago, took the port of Nombre de Dios. He
is called Francisco Drac, and is a man about 35 years of age, low of
stature, with a fair beard, and is one of the greatest mariners that
sails the seas, both as a navigator and as a commander. His vessel is
a galleon of nearly 400 tons and is a perfect sailor. She is manned
with a hundred men, all of service, and of an age for warfare, and all
are as practised therein as old soldiers from Italy could be. Each one
takes particular pains to keep his arquebuse clean. He treats them
with affection, and they treat him with respect. He carries with him
nine or ten cavaliers, cadets of English noblemen. These form part of
his council which he calls together for even the most trivial matter,
although he takes advice from no one. But he enjoys hearing what they
say and afterwards issues his orders. He has no favourite.</p>

<p>The aforesaid gentlemen sit at his table, as well as a Portuguese
pilot, ... who spoke not a word all the time I was on board. He is
served on silver dishes with gold borders and gilded garlands in which
are his arms. He carries all possible dainties and perfumed waters. He
said that many of these had been given him by the Queen.</p>

<p>None of these gentlemen took a seat or covered his head before
him, until he repeatedly urged him to do so. This galleon of his
carries about thirty heavy pieces of artillery and a great quantity
of firearms with the requisite ammunition and lead. He dines and sups
to the music of viols. He carries trained carpenters and artisans, so
as to be able to careen the ship at any time. Besides being new, the
ship has a double lining. I understood that all the men he carries
with him receive wages, because, when our ship was sacked, no man
dared take anything without his orders. He shows them great favour,
but punishes the least fault. He also carries painters who paint for
him pictures of the coast in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119"
id="Page_119">[119]</a></span> its exact colours. This I was most
grieved to see, for each thing is so naturally depicted that no one who
guides himself according to these paintings can possibly go astray.
I understood from him that he had sailed from his country with five
vessels, four sloops (of the long kind) and that half of the armada
belonged to the Queen. I believe this to be so for the reason that I am
about to relate to Your Excellency.</p>

<p>This Corsair, like a pioneer, arrived two months before he intended
to pass through [the strait] and during that time for many days there
were great storms. So it was that one of the gentlemen, whom he had
with him, said to him: &#8220;We have been a long while in this strait
and you have placed all of us, who follow or serve you, in danger of
death. It would therefore be prudent for you to give order that we
return to the North Sea, where we have the certainty of capturing
prizes, and that we give up seeking to make new discoveries. You see
how fraught with difficulties these are.&#8221; This gentleman must
have sustained this opinion with more vigour than appeared proper to
the General. His answer was that he had the gentleman carried below
deck and put in irons. On another day, at the same hour, he ordered him
to be taken out, and to be beheaded in the presence of all.</p>

<p>The term of his imprisonment was no more than was necessary to
substantiate the lawsuit that was conducted against him. All this he
told me, speaking much good about the dead man, but adding that he had
not been able to act otherwise, because this was what the Queen&#8217;s
service demanded. He showed me the commissions he had received from her
and carried....</p>

<p>I managed to ascertain whether the General was well liked, and all
said that they adored him.</p>

<p>This is what I was able to find out during the time I spent with
him.</p>

<p>I beseech Your Excellency to consider what encouragement it will be
to those of his country if he returns thither. If up to the present
they have sent cadets, henceforth they themselves will come, after
seeing how the plans which this Corsair had made in the dark, and all
his promises have come true. He will give them, as proofs of [the
success of] his venture, great sums of gold and silver.</p>

ILLUSTRATIONS OF LIFE IN THE SIXTEENTH AND
SEVENTEENTH CENTURIES</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTORY NOTES</h3>

<p class="subhead">Hansards in London</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Stow&#8217;s</span> account
of the Steelyard and the work of the Easterlings, is valuable for
the history of trade. It exhibits the alien as the great importer,
practically monopolizing the foreign trade with England up to the reign
of Henry IV, and continuing to dominate it till Elizabeth ended their
privileges. It also shows their relations with self-governing London,
and in the whole story can be traced the working out of conditions
which the English later applied to their own overseas enterprises.
The status of Merchant Adventurers, East India Company, etc., as
self-governing communities privileged to exist in a foreign country
seems the precise reproduction of the Hansard in England, and often
reproduced the same injustice for the native merchant. The report of
R. Wynyngton&#8217;s capture of the Hansard fleet should be read in
conjunction with this, and the position of the Hansards also compared
to that of gilds of English merchants.</p>

<p class="subhead">London Extracts</p>

<p>The enumeration of places, recently open country, serves to make
vivid the part London was playing in the great increase of population
and wealth due to the cloth industry, and the foreign adventures
in trade of the Tudor period. The vivid Rembrandt picture of the
night-watch suggests the utter darkness of the narrow medi&aelig;val
lanes and alleys; while the regulations for rebuilding London give
further suggestive details, e.g. shop-windows are still temporary,
houses hitherto neither flush with one line of pavement nor of one
height or style, and wood and thatch still prevail. The account of
Skinner&#8217;s Well also emphasizes this period of transition from
an age of intimate feudal relations between great and small, with its
accompanying inequalities, to the more individualistic and mercantile
relations of the modern world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121"
id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p class="subhead">East Indies</p>

<p>Sir T. Roe&#8217;s embassy from James I to the Great Mogul
(Jehanghir), gives the best account of that Indian court and
government, and of the trade and position of the East India Co., still
in its teens. The Portuguese, under Albuquerque, had created an empire
in the Persian Gulf and Indian shores a century earlier. This had been
challenged by Dutch traders, especially in the islands of the Indian
Ocean and Malay Straits, who, in 1604, formed the Dutch East India
Co. Persia had always traded with the Mogul Empire. Roe gives in this
passage a valuable sketch of the relations of all five races, and lays
down firmly the policy on which the English Company always hereafter
insisted in theory, though constantly forced to abandon it in practice,
namely that trade, and not territory, was their aim.</p>

<p>He also sets up the standard of honesty and honour in face of
Oriental despotism, which British officials have always been expected
to maintain. His statement, too, of the need of carefully selected
presents, shows that the old practice seen in the Old Testament
scriptures still existed in Asiatic negotiations. The Company&#8217;s
servants found themselves from the first obliged both to give and to
receive them, even despite the Company&#8217;s orders, and in 1773
&#8220;a talent of silver and two changes of raiment,&#8221; i.e. a
Kelaat, was the recognized gift of the Mogul&#8217;s messenger.</p>

<p>The account of a &#8220;Court&#8221; meeting of the East India
Company&#8217;s Committees in London gives a glimpse of the regular
course of their work in dividing gains, etc., and has an especially
interesting note of the way they conducted their relations with the
King, their debtor, through the mediation of a famous courtier.</p>

<p>Captain Rannie&#8217;s evidence, as a Company&#8217;s military
officer on the spot, is striking as showing how the struggle between
Dupleix and Clive in the Carnatic had reacted by alarming the Nawabs
of Bengal; and, again, in tracing their hostility further to the
interference with trade and its dues, on which, perhaps as much as
on land-dues, the ruler&#8217;s treasury depended. These were the
grievances which caused our later troubles with Mir Jaffier and Mir
Cossim, our own nominees, and they were not ended till Warren Hastings,
with twenty years&#8217; experience as a trader, came to govern and to
reform them in 1773.</p>

<p class="subhead">Life of T. Raymond</p>

<p>The chief value of these extracts lies in the insight they give
into the domestic life of courtiers, of an ambassadors&#8217;
suite, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122"
id="Page_122">[122]</a></span> common soldiers and officers on
campaign, of the utter ruin of the population at the seat of war. This
is an interesting commentary on the condition to which most of the
German states must have been reduced during the incessant campaigning
of the Thirty Years&#8217; War.</p>

<p class="subhead">A Court Leet</p>

<p>Both the origin and name of courts leet is obscure; they were
possibly survivals of the Anglo-Saxon hundred courts, seem to have
a popular origin, and were certainly the courts in which review of
Frankpledge was held, and other petty police work done.</p>

<p class="subhead">Dugdale&#8217;s &#8220;History of Draining&#8221;</p>

<p>This is valuable for a picture of the gradual process by which
England changed from the fen and forest condition in which the Romans
found it, to the corn-producing country of to-day. The passages quoted
deal with the draining of the area about the Wash, from which the sea
had gradually receded, and which is known as the Great Level, or the
Bedford Level. Dugdale wrote at the close of the Commonwealth period,
and his review brings out the value of the monastic care of the
drainage works up to the dissolution of the abbeys; also the fact that
such undertakings as this requiring capital were managed by companies
of Adventurers, exactly similar to those who took up colonization.
The grants of land by which Bedford and his associates were repaid,
are an instance of the way the members of such Companies grew to be
the plutocrats who, in the eighteenth century, were able to control
politics by the purchase of seats or of votes in Parliament. Bedford
was the recognized head of a great party under George II and George
III.</p>

<h3>LONDON<br />

THE HANSA LEAGUE&#8217;S HOUSE IN LONDON</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(Stow, Book II, p. 202)</p>

<p>Next to [Cofin Lane] is the Stelehouse, or Steleyard (as they term
it) a Place for Merchants of Almaine [German States] that used to
bring hither, as well Wheat, Rye, and other Grain, as Cables, Ropes,
Masts, Pitch, Tarr, Flax,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123"
id="Page_123">[123]</a></span> Hemp, Linen Cloth, Wainscots, Wax,
Steel and other profitable Merchandises. Unto these Merchants, in the
Year 1239, Henry III at the request of his brother, Richard Earl of
Cornwall, King of Almaine, granted that all and singular the Merchants
have a House in the City of London, commonly called Guilda Aula
Theutonicorum, should be maintained and upholden through the whole
Realm, by all such Freedoms, and free Usages or Liberties, as by the
King and in his noble Progenitors Time, they had enjoyed....</p>

<p>And in the 10th Year of the same Edward II Henry Wales being Maior,
a great Controversie did arise between the said Maior and the Merchants
of the Haunce of Almaine, about the Reparations of Bishopsgate, then
likely to fall; for the said Merchants enjoyed divers Privileges, in
respect of maintaining the said Gate, which they now denied to repair
... a Precept was sent to the Maior and Sheriffs, to destrain the said
Merchants to make the Reparations.... And so they granted 210 Marks
sterling to the Maior and Citizens and undertook that they and their
Successors should (from Time to Time), repair the said Gate, and bear
the third Part of the Charges in Money and Men to defend it when need
were.</p>

<p>And for this Agreement, the said Maior and Citizens granted to the
said Merchants their Liberties, which, till of late they have enjoyed;
as, namely, amongst other, that they might lay up their Grain, which
they brought into this Realm, in Inns, and sell it in their Garners, by
the Space of forty Days after they had laid it up, except by the Maior
and Citizens they were expressly forbidden because of Dearth, or other
reasonable Occasions. Also they might have their Alderman, as they
had been accustomed, foreseen always, that he were of the City, and
presented to the Maior and Aldermen of the City, so oft as any should
be chosen, and should take an Oath before them to maintain Justice in
their Courts, and to behave themselves in their Office according to
Law, and as it stood with the Customs of the City....</p>

<p>Their Hall is large, builded of Stone, with three arched Gates
towards the Street, the middlemost whereof is far bigger than the
other, and is seldom opened, and the other two be mured up: The same is
now called the Old Hall. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124"
id="Page_124">[124]</a></span> later time, to wit ... Richard II they
hired one House next adjoining.... This also was a great House, with
a large Wharf on the Thames. And the way thereunto was called ...
Windgoose Alley, for that the same Alley is (for the most part) builded
on by the Stilyard Merchants (p. 204).</p>

<p class="p2">About the time of King Henry IV the English began to
trade themselves into the East Parts. At which the Easterlings,
or Merchants of the Dutch Hauns, were so offended
that they took several of their Ships and Goods.... The
result of which in short was this, that the said King Henry IV
did revoke Parts of the Privileges of the aforesaid Dutch
Company as were inconsistent with the carrying on of a Trade
by the Natives of this Realm: And ... grant his first
Charter to the [English Merchants trading into the East
Land].</p>

<p>In the first and second of Philip and Mary, was granted the
Charter to the Russia Company afterwards confirmed by ...
Queen Elizabeth. Until whose time, though the Trade of
this Nation was driven much more by the Natives thereof,
than had been formerly, yet had the Society of the Dutch
Hans at the Steel Yard much the advantage of them by means
of their well-regulated Societies and the Privileges they
enjoyed. Insomuch that almost the whole Trade was driven
by them, to that degree that Queen Elizabeth herself, when she
came to have a War, was forced to buy the Hemp, Pitch, Tar,
Powder, and other naval Provisions; which she wanted, of
Foreigners: and that too at their Rates. Nor was there
any Stores of either in the Land, to supply her Occasions on
a sudden, but what at great Rates she prevailed with them to
fetch for her, even in time of War: Her own subjects then
being but very little Traders. To remedy which she fell
upon the Consideration [of] encouraging her own subjects
to be Merchants ... and cancelling many of the Privileges
of the afore-mentioned Dutch Hans Society, the Trade in
general by degrees came to be managed by the Natives of
this Realm. And consequently the Profit of all these Trades
accrued to the English Nation. Trade in general and English
Shipping was encreased; her own Customs vastly augmented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
and, what was at first the great End of all, obtained, viz.,
that she had constantly lying at home, in the Hands of her
own Subjects, all sorts of naval Provisions and Stores; which
she could make use of, as her Occasions required them without
any dependence on her Neighbours for the same. And thus
by means of encouraging the ... Merchant Adventurers ...
was the Trade at first gained from the Foreigners....
Then is one other great House ... which in the fifteenth
of Edward IV was confirmed unto the said Merchants
(p. 205).</p>

<p>In the year 1551 ... through Complaint of the English
Merchants, the Liberty of the Steelyard Merchants was seized
into the King&#8217;s Hands, and so it resteth.</p>

<h4>CHANGES IN LONDON</h4>

<p class="subhead2">(Stow, Book II, p. 1)</p>

<p>This great and populous City contains in the whole six or seven
hundred Streets, Lanes, Alleys, Courts and Yards of Name, and generally
very full of Inhabitants. Before the late dreadful Fire of London, the
Houses within the Walls were computed to be about 13000; and that is
accounted not a sixthe Part ... and in these late Years whole Fields
have been converted into Builded Streets, ... as the great Buildings
about the Abbey of Westminster, Tuthill Fields, and those Parts; Then
the greatest part of St. James&#8217; Parish, ... all the Streets in
the Soho Fields,. .. also all Bloomsbury ... all Hatton Garden ... the
Great and Little Lincoln&#8217;s Inn Fields, all Covent Garden ...
etc., etc., and in the East and North Parts, the Spittle Fields, etc.
All which were only Fields and Waste Grounds.</p>

<p class="subhead2">1598. (Ibid. p. 242)</p>

<p>In our Time ... other [Enormities] are come in place ... meet to
be reformed. And first ... Encroachments on the High Ways, Lanes, and
common Grounds, in and about this City....</p>

<p>Then the number of Cars, Drays, Carts, and Coaches,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span> more
than hath been accustomed (the Streets and Lanes being straightened),
must needs be dangerous, as daily Experience proveth.</p>

<p>The Coachman rides behind the Horse Tails, lasheth them and looketh
not behind him. The drayman sitteth and sleepeth on his Dray and
letteth his Horse lead him home.</p>

<p>I know, that by the good Laws and Customs of this City, shod<a
name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28"
class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Carts are forbidden to enter the same, except
upon reasonable Causes (as the Service of the Prince, or such like)
they be tolerated. Also that the Fore Horse of every Carriage, should
be led by Hand. But these good orders are not observed.</p>

<p>[In the time of King Richard II] Anne, Daughter to the King of
Bohemia ... first brought hither the riding upon side-saddles; and so
was the riding in ... Whirlicotes and Chariots forsaken ... but now of
late Years, the Use of Coaches brought out of Germany, is taken up and
made so common, as there is neither Distinction of Time, nor Difference
of Persons observed; for the World runs on Wheels with many, whose
Parents were glad to go on foot.</p>

<h3>CAUSES OF THE FIRE OF LONDON</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(Stow, I, p. 227)</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;Natural causes which might occasion such a
general ruin.&#8221;</p>

<p>1. The Time of the Night when it first began, viz., between One and
Two of the Clock after Midnight, when all were in a dead Sleep.</p>

<p>2. It was Saturday Night, when many of the most eminent Citizens,
Merchants and others, were retired into the Country, and none but
servants left to look to their City Houses.</p>

<p>3. It was in the Long Vacation ... when many wealthy Citizens and
Tradesmen are wont to be in the Country at Fairs, and getting in of
Debts, and making up Accounts with their Chapmen.</p>

<p>4. The closeness of the Building and Narrowness of the Streets,
in the Places where it began [i.e., Pudding Lane] did<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span> much
to facilitate the Progress of the Fire; by hindring of the Engines to
be brought to play upon the Houses on Fire.</p>

<p>5. The Matter of which the Houses, all thereabouts, were; viz.
Timber, and those very old.</p>

<p>6. The Dryness of the preceding Season; there having been a
great Drought even to that very Day, and all the Time that the Fire
continued, which had so dried the Timber, that it was never more apt to
take Fire.</p>

<p>7. The Nature of the Wares and Commodities stowed and vended in
those Parts, were the most Combustible of any other sold in the whole
City: as Oyl, Pitch, Tar, Cordage, Hemp, Flax, Rosin, Wax, Butter,
Cheese, Wine, Brandy, Sugar, etc.</p>

<p>8. An Easterly Wind (which is the dryest of all others)&mdash;had
blown for several Days together before; and at that Time very
strongly.</p>

<p>9. The unexpected failing of the Water thereabouts at that Time; For
the Engine at the North End of Tower Bridge, called the Thames Water
Tower (which supplied all that part of the City with Thames Water) was
out of Order, and in a few Hours was itself burnt down, so that the
Water Pipes, which conveyed the Water from thence through the Streets
were soon empty.</p>

<p>10. Lastly: An unusual Negligence at first, and a confidence of
easily quenching it, and of its stopping at several probable places
afterwards; turned at length to a Confusion, Consternation and Despair;
People choosing rather by Flight to save their Goods, than by a
vigorous Opposition to save their own Houses and the whole City.</p>

<p>To all which Reasons must not be passed over the general Suspicion
that most then had of Incendiaries, laying combustible Stuff in many
Places, having observed divers distant Houses to be on Fire together.
And many were then taken up on Suspicion.</p>

<h4>THE REBUILDING OF THE CITY</h4>

<p class="subhead2">(Ibid., p. 231)</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the extraordinary Losses by the forementioned Fire,
the devouring Pestilence in this City the<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span> Year preceding, and the
chargeable War with the Dutch at that Time depending yet by ... the
Diligence and Activity of the Lord Maior, Aldermen, and Commoners of
the said City (who were almost the only Losers by that fatal Accident)
was in the Space of Four or Five Years well nigh rebuilded.</p>

<h4>LONDON NIGHT-WATCHES</h4>

<p class="subhead2">(Stow, ibid., p. 256)</p>

<p>Besides the standing Watches, all in bright Harness, in every Ward
and Street in this City and Suburbs, there was also a marching Watch,
that passed through the principal Streets thereof, to wit, from the
Little Conduit by Paul&#8217;s Gate through West Cheap, by the Stocks,
through Cornhill (etc., etc.), to Aldgate and up Grasse Church Street
into Cornhill, and through into West Cheap again, and so broke up.
The whole Way (measured) ... 3200 Taylors Yards of Assize. For the
Furniture whereof with Lights, there were appointed 700 Cressets, 500
of them being formed by the Companies, the other 200 by the Chamber of
London. Besides the which Lights, every Constable in London, in number
more than 240 had his Cresset ... and every Cresset had two Men, one to
bear or hold it, another to bear a Bag with Light, and to serve it: so
that the Poor Men pertaining to the Cressets taking Wages, besides that
everyone had a Strawen Hat, with a Badge painted, and his Breakfast,
amounted in number to almost 2000. The Marching Watch contained in
number about 2000 Men; part of them being old Soldiers, of<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span> skill
to be Captains, etc., ... Drummers, Demi-launces on great Horses,
Gunners with hand Guns, ... Archers in Coats of white Fustian, signed
on the Breast and Back with the Arms of the City, their Bows bent in
their Hands, with Sheafs of Arrows by their Sides, Pikemen in bright
Corselets, ... Bellmen in Almain Rivets, and Aprons of Mail in great
Number.</p>

<p>There were also divers Pageants, Morris Dancers, Constables, the
one half of which was 120, on St. John&#8217;s Eve, the other half on
St. Peter&#8217;s Eve, in bright Harness, some over Gilt, and every
one a Jornet of Scarlet thereupon, and a Chain of Gold, his Hench
Men following him, his Minstrels before him, and his Cornet Light
passing by him: the Waits of the City, the Maior&#8217;s Officers,
for his Guard before him, all in a Livery of Worsted or Sea Jackets,
party-coloured; the Maior himself, well mounted on Horseback, the Sword
Bearer before him in fair Armour, well mounted also; the Maior&#8217;s
Foot Men, and the like Torch Bearers about him; Hench Men twain, upon
great Stirring Horses following him.</p>

<h4>WRESTLING AT SKINNER&#8217;S WELL</h4>

<p class="subhead2">(Ibid., p. 257)</p>

<p>In the Month of August, about the Feast of S. Bartholomew the
Apostle, before the Lord Maior, Aldermen and Sheriffs of London,
placed in a large Tent near unto Clerkenwell, of old time were divers
Days spent in the Pastime of Wrestling; where the Officers of the
City, namely the Sheriffs, Sergeants and Yeomen, the Porters of the
King&#8217;s Beam, or Weigh House (now no such Men) and other of the
City, were challengers of all Men in the Suburbs, to wrestle for
Games appointed. And on other Days, before the said Maior, Aldermen
and Sheriffs, in Finsbury Field to shoot the Standard, broad Arrow
and flight, for Games. But now of late Years, the wrestling is only
practised on Bartholomew Day in the Afternoon, and the Shooting some
three or four Days after, in one Afternoon and no more.</p>

<p>What should I speak of the ancient, daily Exercises in the
long bow by Citizens of this City, now almost cleanly left<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span> off
and forsaken? I overpass it. For by the Means of closing in of Common
Grounds, our Archers for want of room to shoot Abroad, creep into
Bowling Alleys, and ordinary Dicing Houses, near Home; where they have
room enough to hazard their Money at unlawful Games, where I leave them
to take their pleasures.</p>

<p>This was one of the great Uses of Publick Houses in former
Time, namely for Game and Exercise rather than for drinking
excessively....</p>

<p>Now a Days the Recreations of the Citizens, besides Drinking, are
Cockfighting, Bowling greens, Tables, Cards, Dice, Billiard Tables,
Musick Entertainments, Dancing, Masks, Balls, Stage Plays, Club
Meetings in Evenings, Riding out on Horseback, Hunting with My Lord
Maior&#8217;s Pack of Dogs, when the Common Hunt goes out; the Citizens
having Privilege by their Charter to hunt in Middlesex, Hertfordshire,
in the Chilterns, and in Kent as far as Gray Water.</p>

<p>The more common sort divert themselves at Football; Wrestling,
Cudgels, Ninepins, Shovelboard, Cricket, Stowball, Ringing of Bells,
Quoits, pitching the Bar, Bull and Bear baiting, throwing at Cocks.</p>

<h3>THE USE OF ARMS. C. 1588</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(Holinshed, II, 16)</p>

<p>&#8220;In times past, the chief force of England consisted in their
long bows. But now we have in manner generally given over that kind of
artillery.... But as our shooting is thus, in manner, utterly decayed
among us one way: so our countrymen wax skilful in sundry other points
as in shooting in small pieces, the caliver, and handling of the pike
in the several uses whereof they are become very expert.</p>

<p>Our armour differeth not from that of other nations; and therefore
consisteth of corselets, almain rivets, shirts of mail, jacks quilted
and covered with leather, fustian, or canvas over thick plates of
iron that are sewed in the same ... of which there is no town or
village that hath not her convenient furniture. The said armour and
munition is kept in one, several place of every town, appointed
by the consent of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132"
id="Page_132">[132]</a></span> whole parish; where it is always ready
to be had and worn within an hour&#8217;s warning.... Certes, there is
almost no village so poor in England, be it never so small, that hath
not sufficient furniture in a readiness to set forth three or four
soldiers (as, one archer, one gunner, one pike, and a billman,) at the
least. No, there is not so much wanting as their very liveries and
caps; which are least to be accounted of, if any haste required....</p>

<p>Seldom shall you see any of my countrymen, above eighteen or twenty
years old, to go without a dagger at the least, at his back or by his
side; although they be aged burgesses or magistrates of any city, who,
in appearances are most exempt from brabbling and contention.</p>

<p>Our Nobility commonly wear swords or rapiers, with their daggers as
doth every common serving man also that followeth his lord and master.
Finally no man travelleth by the way, without his sword or some such
weapon, with us; except the Minister who commonly weareth none at all,
unless it be a dagger or hanger at his side.&#8221;</p>

<h4>LETTER TO THE EAST INDIA CO., 24 NOV., 1616</h4>

<p>... Your residence you need not doubt as long as you tame the
Portugall ... he only can prejudice you. For a Fort, at my first
arrival I received it as very necessary; but experience teaches me
we are refused it to our advantage. If he [Jahangir] would offer me
ten, I would not accept one. First, where the river is commodious,
the country is barren and untraded.... Secondly the charge is greater
than the trade can bear; for to maintain a garrison will eat the
profit.... A war and traffic are incompatible. By my consent, you
shall no way engage yourselves but at sea, where you are like to
gain as often as to lose. It is the beggaring of the Portugall,
notwithstanding his many rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133"
id="Page_133">[133]</a></span> residencies and territories, that he
keeps soldiers that spend it; yet his garrisons are mean. He never
profited by the Indies since he defended them. Observe this well. It
hath been also the error of the Dutch, who seek plantation here by the
sword. They turn a wonderful stock, they prowl in all places, they
possess some of the best; yet their dead payes consume all the gain.
Let this be received as a rule that if you will profit, seek it at sea,
and in quiet trade; for without controversy it is an error to affect
garrisons and land wars in India. If you made it only against the
naturals [natives] I would agree....</p>

<p>... The road of Swally or the Port of Surat are fittest for you in
all the Mogul&#8217;s territory.... You need no more; it is not number
of ports, factories and residences that will profit you; they will
increase charge but not recompense it.... The commodities you sell pass
best in that quarter. The goods you seek being principally indigo and
cloth (calicoes).</p>

<p>For the settling your trafique here, I doubt not to effect any
reasonable desire. My credit is sufficient with the King [great Mogul],
and your force will alway bind him to constancy.... But you must alter
your stock. Let not your servants deceive you; cloth, lead, teeth
[ivory], quicksilver are dead commodities and will never drive this
trade. You must succour it by change....</p>

<p>Articles of treaty on equal terms I cannot effect: want of presents
disgraced me. But yet by pieces I have gotten as much as I desired at
once. I have recovered all bribes, extortions, debts made and taken
before my time till this day; or at least an honourable composition.
But when I deliver the next gifts to the Mogul.... I will set on
anew for a formal contract.... Concerning private trade, [of the
Company&#8217;s servants] my opinion is you absolutely prohibit it
and execute forfeiture, for your business will be the better done.
All your loss is not in the goods brought home. I see here the
inconveniences you think not of. I know this is harsh to all men and
seems hard; men profess they come not out for bare wages. You shall
take away the plea if you resolve to give very good to men&#8217;s
content; then you know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134"
id="Page_134">[134]</a></span> what you part from. But you must make
good choice of your servants and use fewer.</p>

<p class="subhead">Note of Goods for Presents</p>

<p>Table knives, swords, gilt armour, precious stones, cloth of gold,
looking glasses, arras, pictures, wines (strong waters are unrequested
now), dogs, ostrich plumes, silk stuffs (&#8220;but no blue, it is the
colour of mourners&#8221;) and generally any rare knack to please the
eye.... (p. 356).</p>

<h4>LETTER TO MASTER SECRETARY WYNWODE, NOV. 30, 1616</h4>

<p>&#8220;The trade is profitable and fit for England, but no way
understood by the Company how to effect it at best advantage.... I
assure your Honour it is not fit to keep an Ambassador in this Court. I
have shuffled better out and escaped and avoided affronts and slavish
customs clearer than ever any did. I am allowed rank above the Persian,
but he outstrips me in rewards; his Master lies near us. But His
Majesty commanded me to do nothing unworthy the honour of a Christian
King, and no reward can humble me to any baseness&#8221; (p. 358).</p>

<h4>A COURT OF COMMITTEES, AUGUST 4, 1641</h4>

<p>Nathaniel Hawes transfers to Robert Freeman 942l. 10s. adventure
and profits in the Third Joint Stock, (subscribed in 1631) &#8216;the
principal being divided.&#8217;</p>

<p>The Court, understanding that 438 bales of Legee silk, 50 bales of
Ardas, and 39 of Mazandran were returned in the (E.I.C.s&#8217; ship)
<cite>Crispian</cite>, directs that each adventurer shall receive for his division
five-sixths in Legee, and one-sixth in Ardas or Mazandran and desires
three Committees to oversee the delivery of the said divisions.</p>

<p>Captain Stiles is desired to go aboard the <cite>Hopewell</cite> and give
directions for all her lumber, guns and ordnance to be<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
put ashore, all private trade to be sent up to the Custom House, and
nothing more to be unladen until further order.</p>

<p>The Governor opines that as the year is passing, the generality
should be called together about a new subscription for a Particular
Voyage for this year; after some debate it is resolved to await the
King&#8217;s recommendation upon the Company&#8217;s petition to
Parliament for renewal of its charter. The Court decides to present Sir
Harry Vane, who is and always has been ready to assist the Company on
all occasions, with &#8216;fifty pieces.&#8217;</p>

<p>Mr. Ashwell to be paid for the looking glass he sent to Bantam.
Mr. Stiles reports that he has been offered 4l. 10s. per ton for the
defective ordnance, 10s. per ton more than the last was sold for; and
is told to use his own judgement in this matter. John Gearing, his son
John, and Richard Crawly are accepted as securities for cloves. The
estate of the late William Fall, a factor in Persia, to be paid to
his executrix. Certain Committees are desired to hear the difference
between Mrs. Powell and Thomas Clarke who lately returned from
India.</p>

<h3>YOUNG COURTIER&#8217;S LIFE IN LONDON, C. 1630</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(<cite>Autobiography of Thomas Raymond.</cite> Ed. G. Davies.
Camden Series III, Vol. 28, p. 26)</p>

<p>I was taken from the Citty, where I expected to be planted, and
brought to Courte, attending my unkle, whoe grew so rigorous that my
life thereby became very unpleasant, and leaving the Citty for the
Courte I was with the proverbe fallen out of the frying pan into the
fier. Long waiting and short meales, sometimes cutt wholly out at my
first coming by the voracity and nimbleness of the courtiers, and if
by chance I was necessitated to make to our lodgings for dynner, I
was sure to be entertayned with a look and words would almost fright
the devill. But after a while by getting courage and acquaintance I
made partly shift abroade, choosing rather to fast then go home and be
rated. I remember my aunt was one day seemingly very importunate with
a good neighbour woman, whoe came to visit her, to stay and dyne<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
with hir. Whereupon my aunt called to hir mayde, &#8220;Nan sett on
the whole rash of mutton,&#8221; which the good woman hearing tooke
occasion to break away, haveing a farre better dynner at home.</p>

<p>Another tyme there was boyling on the fier in my unkle&#8217;s
chamber a pipkin of pease pottage, and a Lord comeing to him
unexpectedly on the sudden aboute business, with stifling aboute least
the pipkin should be seene it was throwne downe, broke, and all the
porridge aboute the chamber&mdash;a woefull disaster to my aunt for the
losse of hir belly tymber, and to my unkle least the Lord should have
taken us in our cookery and misfortune. But the Lord was encountered
before he could perceive the mischeife, a miscarriage that often made
me laugh heartily. Our lodgings were in a little straight howse built
in a corner on the lefte hand as soon as you are out of the East door
of Westminster Abbey, bellonging to one of the vergers of the Church,
and is since demolished. My chanber was just under there, high towards
on pynacle of the Abbey, and in rayney or wyndy nights there would
fall downe upon the leades of the roofe of my chanber such huge pieces
of freestone (those parts of the Church being much decayed and dayly
decaying) that I often tymes thought I should be knocked on the head
before morning. My unkle, being wondered at and sometymes laughed at
for the place of his lodgings ... had a story to defend it....</p>

<p>Our remove from these lodgings was to Whitehall, and there in the
third story of the first greate stone gate passing towards King strete
where are kept the papers of state, whereof my unkle was now one of the
clerkes and keepers. And here my condition was somewhat better ... that
I was saved from the feare of being brayned in my bed, and only my legs
had here the worst ont by mounting soe high soe often in the day.</p>

<h3>PRIVILEGES OF AMBASSADORS, C. 1635</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(Raymond, p. 57)</p>

<h4>VENICE</h4>

<p>The persons and howses of ambassadors are by the lawes of all
nations sacred, and in this place as much as anywhere.<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span> Not
only their howses are privileged but a considerable distance from them,
within which no officer of justice must presume to come to follow or
fetch away any offender that flies thither. And these priviledges are
often abused by the attendants of ambassadors, whoe are too ready to
protect offenders against the lawe. There stood very nere our Pallace
a little howse into which certayne offenders had fledd, and there not
only sheltred themselves, but contrary to the lawes of the place kept
dicing and carding. Complaint was made thereof to the ambassador, that
he would either cause them to be delivered to the justice or chase
them from thence. But the ambassador, possibly by meanes of some of
his servants, turned the deaf eare to their just requests, whereupon,
after some waiting the ambassador&#8217;s answers, in the dead tyme
of night came the bargello with his men, and tooke these fellows out
of their beds, and carried them to prison. And well for us it was
that it was done when we were all asleepe, otherwise wee must have
defended our priviledges, though to the great endangering of our own
lives and those officers. This bred a great difference between the
State and my lord ambassador, who said the howse was his, and that the
officers had violated the laws of nations by this proceeding, craved
the persons taken out of the howse should be returned thither and the
bergello and his officers severely punished for their impudence, etc.
This matter proceeded to that height that the ambassador was ready to
quitt the place, and a rupture between England and the Republick like
to follow, but was at the last with much ado composed to the honour
and satisfaction of the ambassador and the Republick. In the agitation
of which business, being very hott on both sides, the King himselfe,
good King Charles, did write once or twice to my lord ambassador with
his owne handd, in which appeared his greate prudence and noe small
affection for the person of the ambassador. (Basil, Lord Feilding).</p>

<h3>EXPERIENCES OF A SOLDIER</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(Raymond, p. 73)</p>

<h4>FLANDERS, A.D. 1633</h4>

<p>I observed how briske and fyne some English gallants were at the
beginning of this campagne, but at the latter end ther briskenes and
gallantry soe faded and clowdy that I could not but be mynded of the
vanity of this world with the uneasiness of this profession. And truly,
by what I have seene and felt, I cannott but thinck that the life of a
private or comon soldier is the most miserable in the world; and that
not soe much because his life is always in danger&mdash;that is little
or nothing&mdash;but for the terrible miseries he endures in hunger and
nakedness, in hard marches and bad quarters, 30 stivers being his pay
for 8 days, of which they could not possibly subsist, but that they
helpe themselves by forraging, stealing, furnishing wood in the feild
to the officers, straw, some are cobblers, taylers, etc. Straw is ready
money, especially at first comeing to new quarters. I remember at one
place I saw a couple of soldiers that had found a little howse filled
with strawe. One of them kept the dore whilst the other carried out the
strawe by bunches to sell. Other soldiers came and would have part:
these withstood them. At last others fell to chopping of the 4 corner
posts, soe in a short tyme downe fell the howse and soe the strawe
grew comon. It is hardly to be thought the devastation that an army
brings into a countrie, and the hangers on of the army doe most of the
mischeife. They march in no order, carry hookes by which they search
wells and ditches for pewter or brasse that the poore countrie people
have sunck to preserve them from the soldiers. Other places they dig
up where they suspect anything to be hid, torturing the poore people
to make them confesse, etc. Sometymes we came to a goodly feild of
corne, which within a few minutes is trod flatt, to the very ground:
faire howses unthatched, all the plancher and wood work chopped downe
if not fyred, pleasant orchards and walkes of trees in an instant
chopped downe by the ground, etc. It pittyed me at one place where we
marched by a poore little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139"
id="Page_139">[139]</a></span> howse, to which joined a little close of
about an acre with bush. The poore woman came out, felled on hir knees,
and holding up hir hands, praying the soldiers for Christ Jesus&#8217;
sake to spare hir cropp. Twas all, she sayd, that she and hir poore
children had to live on all the yere, makeing lamentable outcryes, but
all to noe purpose. For, though there was forrage enough just by, with
in a few minutes all this poore creatures crop was wholly destroyed.</p>

there ought to be six days appointed for amending of highwayes, eight
houres eury day, vpon paine of xxs to bee lost by the Superuisors.
And every one that hath a cart to send two able men with it, with
tooles fit for that seruice, or else to lose twelve pence for euery
day wanting. And they ought most chiefly to amend the wayes leading to
Market Townes; and they may gather stones in any man&#8217;s grounds,
and also digge pits of ten yards square in any man&#8217;s seuerall
for stones and rubbish (if it be needful), filling the same vp againe,
without danger of Law. And they must turne springs, if they can, out of

<h3>DRAINING OF THE FENS</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(Dugdale, <cite>History of Imbanking and Draining</cite>, p.
375)</p>

<p>It hath been a long received opinion, as well by the borderers
upon the Fens as others, that the total drowning of this Great Level
(whereof we have in our times been eyewitnesses) hath for the most
part, been occasioned by the neglect of putting the laws of sewers in
due execution in these latter times; and that before the dissolution of
the monasteries by King Henry VIII the passages for the water were kept
with cleansing, and the banks with better repair, chiefly through the
care and cost of those religious houses.</p>

<p>... but wholly to clear them was impossible without the perfect
opening and cleansing of their natural outfalls.... In order whereunto
the first considerable attempt ... was in 20 Eliz. the Queen then
granting her commission to Sir Thomas Cecil, Sir W. Fitzwilliams, Sir
Edward Montague and Sir Henry Cromwell, Knights, etc. Howbeit ...
little was done.... But King James ... encouraged their proceedings
therein, expressing his readiness to allow a part of his own lands to
be so recovered, towards the charge of the work, in like proportion
that other of his subjects should do....</p>

<p>After this ... the lords of the ... Privy Council ... desired
them [the commissioners] to endeavour to satisfy all such persons as
having no respect to the general good ... should oppose it ... the
said commissioners ... concluded (with one consent) that this work
of draining was feasible ... and most beneficial to the countries
interested, to have good by, that ever was taken in hand of that kind
in those days; ... The commissioners names subscribed thereto being
these, viz.:</p>

<p>Oliver Cromwell, etc., Thomas Lambert, Robert Cromwell, Ireby, etc.,
etc.</p>

<p>Whereupon there was a particular view of the whole Level, begun
... (21 June, 1605) and ... the king himself ... incited them to fall
in hand speedily with the work and the rather because that was a dry
summer, and so the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148"
id="Page_148">[148]</a></span> proper for it ... intimating also that,
for the better expediting thereof, he had employed his Chief Justice
Popham to take pains therein ... they had information ... that in
several places of recovered grounds, within the isle of Ely, etc. such
as before that time had lived upon alms having no help but by fishing
and fowling and such poor means, out of the common Fens, while they lay
drowned, were since come to good and supportable estates.</p>

<p>The limitation of time allowed to Sir John Popham, knight, Lord
Chief Justice, and the rest of the adventurers, for accomplishing the
work, was to be ten years ...</p>

<p>... for the space of five years at the least ... there nothing
appeareth of consequence to have been prosecuted therein, by reason of
the opposition which divers perverse spirited people made thereto ...
by bringing of turbulent suits in law ... and making of libellous songs
...</p>

<h4>THE POWTES COMPLAINT</h4>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>Come, Brethren of the water, and let us all assemble</p>
<p>To treat upon this matter, which makes us quake and tremble;</p>
<p>For we shall rue, if it be true, that Fens be undertaken,</p>
<p>And where we feed, in Fen and Reed, they&#8217;ll feed both Beef and Bacon.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>They&#8217;ll sow both beans and oats, where never man yet thought it,</p>
<p>Where men did row in boats, ere undertakers<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29"

<p>But Ceres, thou behold us now, let wild oats be their venture,</p>
<p>Oh, let the frogs and miry bogs destroy where they do enter.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Behold the great design, which they do now determine,</p>
<p>Will make our bodies fine, a prey to crows and vermine:</p>
<p>For they do mean all fens to drain, and waters overmaster,</p>
<p>All will be dry, and we must die, &#8216;cause Essex calves want pasture.</p>
</div>

<hr class="poemtb" />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Away with boats and rudder, farewell both boots and skatches,</p>
<p>No need of one nor th&#8217;other, men now make better matches;</p>
<p>Stilt-makers all and tanners shall complain of this disaster:</p>
<p>For they will make each muddy lake for Essex calves a pasture.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>The feathered fowls have wings, to fly to other nations;</p>

<p>We must give place (oh grievous case) to horned beasts and cattle,</p>
<p>Except that we can all agree to drive them out by battle, etc.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>And upon the 12th of August (1618) ... at a general session of
sewers held at Huntingdon ... there were appointed three commissioners
of every county to accompany ... Sir Clement Edwards (one of the
Clerks of the Council) ... who gave in this following certificate ...
That forasmuch as the inhabitants of Marshland complained much....
And though there were many gentlemen of good worth in those parts who
wanted neither zeal nor judgement to do service therein; yet it was
conceived, that the work might be best effected by such as had no
interest at all in the country.... In pursuance of which order, the
said Earl of Arundel made a journey into those parts; where having
treaty with Sir William Ayloffe, knight, baronet, Anthony Thomas, Esq.,
and others, they ... as undertakers in this great adventure, did make
these following proposals, viz.:</p>

<p>1. To have all the King&#8217;s lands drowned with fresh or salt
water, which should be so recovered, at the free rent of 4d. the acre
...</p>

<p>2. To have all the Prince&#8217;s lands upon the like condition.</p>

<p>3. To have of all subjects lands, so drowned all the year, two
thirds to them the said undertakers ...</p>

<p>4. And of all such lands of subjects which lay drowned half the
year, to have the one half ...</p>

<p class="p2">... the said undertakers did propose to begin their work
at the sea, by opening the outfalls of Nene, and Welland; and to make
the same navigable to Spalding and Wisbech, which would take away all
fear of turning the water upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150"
id="Page_150">[150]</a></span> any neighbour country and draw the same
into their true and natural channels....</p>

<p>... Certain it is, that no farther progress was made therein....
Howbeit ... at King&#8217;s Lynne, upon the 1st of September (1630)
there was a contract made with Sir Cornelius Vermuden, knight (a person
well experienced in works of this kind) for the draining of this Level;
and he, for his recompense therein, to have 95 thousand acres of the
said surrounded lands: But the country not being satisfied to deal
with Sir Cornelius, in regard he was an alien, they ... became humble
suitors to Francis, then Earl of Bedford (who was owner of near 20
thousand acres about Thorney and Whittlesey, of this fenny level) to
undertake the work; at whose request, as also of the commissioners, he
condescended thereto....</p>

<p>These things being thus settled, the said Earl taking in divers
adventurers as participants with him therein, they cast the whole
(95,000 acres) so allowed for their recompense, into 20 parts or
lots....</p>

<p>The said Francis ... etc.... did obtain Letters Patents of
Incorporation ... into a body politic, to be guardians and conservors
of the Fen lands....</p>

<p>All which being accomplished about three years after in a session
of Sewers held at Peterborough, 12 October, 1637, the whole Level was
adjudged drained ... the charge of these works to the said Earl and his
participants having been no less than an hundred thousand pounds....</p>

<p>But ... though the lands were very much improved by those works, yet
were they subject to inundation especially in the winter season....</p>

<p>Hereupon ... Charles I ... did command divers gentlemen to give
their advice ... amongst which ... Vermuden was one ... the king
himself was declared the undertaker; and to have not only those 95,000
acres ... but also 57,000 acres more, to make the same fens as well
winter grounds as summer grounds.... And that though the Earl of
Bedford had not performed his undertaking, he should in recompense
of his great charge in those rivers, cuts and drains ... have 40,000
acres....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151"
id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>The king&#8217;s work [owing to the Civil War] being ...
obstructed.... The Earl, etc., fell in hand with the work ... this main
body of the fens is divided into three distinct Levels, viz., the North
Level, the Middle Level and the South Level ... the Level on the 25th
of March, 1653 was adjudged to be fully drained: Whereupon the said
Earl and his participants had possession of those 95,000 acres awarded
to them.</p>

<h2 class="chap">CHAPTER VIII<br />

EIGHTEENTH CENTURY EXTRACTS</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTORY NOTES</h3>

<div class="f90">

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Military</span>, religious and
constitutional questions are not suitable for children, and are only
touched here in Defoe&#8217;s racy, if partisan, summary. The close of
the first extract gives a clear statement of the theory of a compact by
virtue of which, rather than by Divine right, the Whigs considered the
King to reign.</p>

<p>American affairs, however, played a part in the interests of great
classes of the nation, and in the growth of the empire. &#8220;No
taxation,&#8221; etc., was a party-cry rather than a real grievance;
it was the monopolist trade rules demanded by British merchants that
ultimately caused the war. To meet this monopoly the Americans adopted
the successful policy of refusing to import British goods.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Appeal to France&#8221; shows the motives inciting our
Continental enemies against us and also the weakness of America even
at that date. In the writings of Franklin, Deane, and de Warville, can
be seen the enthusiasm and debate which made the American example the
real cradle of &#8220;Lib&eacute;rt&eacute;, &eacute;galit&eacute;,
fraternit&eacute;,&#8221; a relation not usually stressed in English
history books.</p>

<p>The main effect of the century was the growth of a great capitalist
class able to control the national affairs, drawing their wealth from
the colonies, from new methods of agriculture, or of finance and
industry, such as are seen in the references to Defoe&#8217;s Tour,
Young&#8217;s Northern Tour, the Life of Coutts, and indications of the
new inventions in industry, and the conditions they produced.</p></div>

<h3>A DEFENCE OF DISSENT</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(D. Defoe&#8217;s Works, 2nd edition, <cite>A New Test
of the Church of England&#8217;s Loyalty</cite>, p. 406 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">et seq.</i>)</p>

<p>Our first Reformation from Popery was in the days of King <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>Edward
VI ... &#8216;twas under him that the whole Nation and Government
embraced the Protestant Reformed Religion ... and here it began to be
called the Church of England.</p>

<p>Some enquiring Christians were for making farther steps, and
carrying on the Reformation to a higher degree ... but the return of
Popery under Queen Mary put a stop to the work in general.... Queen
Elizabeth restored it again.... Those who insisted upon the further
Reformation were then called Puritans, because they set up for a
greater purity of worship; and they separated themselves from the
Established Church....</p>

<p>Before this time there was no such thing as Church of
England, it was then the Church of Rome<a name="FNanchor_30_30"
id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30"
class="fnanchor">[30]</a> that was the established National Church.
The Protestants under the title of Lollards, Wickliffians, Hussites,
what did they do? Did they, as our modern people say everybody should
conform to what the Government commanded? No, the present Church of
England party were the Dissenters, the Schismatics and Fanatics, in the
days of Henry VIII were persecuted for not coming to Church, many of
them put to death and always treated with scorn and contempt.... In the
next Ages these come to have the power in their hands and forgetting
that they had found it &#8220;Righteous in the sight of God to obey
God rather than man,&#8221; they treat those whose consciences oblige
them to dissent from them, with the same contempt which themselves had
received from the Roman [church] government.</p>

<p>Thus far they are upon even terms, as to obedience to their
Superiors.</p>

<p>The Dissenters have the first occasion after this to show
their submission under extraordinary pressures. Queen Elizabeth
discountenanced them continually, and as good a queen as she was,
put some of them to death. King James I hunted them quite out of the
kingdom, made thousands of them fly into Holland and Germany, and at
last to New England.... Under the reign of King Charles I, the case
altered, the King and Parliament fell out about matters of civil
rights and invasion of the liberties and properties of the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
people; the Puritans or Dissenters, call them what we please, fell in
unanimously with the Parliament.</p>

<p>And here &#8216;tis worthy of remark, that the first difference
between the King and English Parliament did not respect Religion but
civil property nor were the majority of the House Puritans, but true
Church Protestants and English men. (There were but four Dissenters in
all that Parliament).... (p. 408).</p>

<p>But the Parliament finding the Puritan party stuck close to their
cause, they also came over [to] them when things came to a rupture ...
the Whigs in 41 to 48, took up arms against their King, and having
conquered him and taken him prisoner, cut off his head, because they
had him: the Church of England took up arms against their King in 88,
and did not cut off his head, because they had him not. King Charles
lost his life because he did not run away; and his son, King James,
saved his life because he did run away.... Nay if arguments may be
allowed to have equal weight on both sides, the Whigs have been the
honester of the two, for they never protested any such blind, absolute
and undisputed obedience to Princes, as the others have done.</p>

<p>It has always been their opinion, that Government was originally
contrived by the consent and for the mutual benefit of the parties
governed, that the people have an original, native right to their
property, the liberty of their persons and possessions, unless
forfeited to the Laws; that they cannot be divested of their right
but by their own consent; and that all invasion of this right is
destructive of the Constitution, and dissolves the Compact of
Government and Obedience (p. 411).</p>

<p>They have always declared that they understand their allegiance to
their governors to be, supposing they govern them according to the Laws
of the Land; and that if Princes break this Bond of Government, the
Nature of it is inverted, and the Constitution ceases of course....</p>

<p>This has been the avowed doctrine of the Dissenters, and indeed is
the true sense of the Constitution itself; pursuant to this doctrine,
they thought they had a right to oppose violence with force; believing
that when Kings break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155"
id="Page_155">[155]</a></span> Coronation Oaths, the Solemn Compact
with their people, and encroach upon their civil rights, contrary to
the Laws of the Land, by which they are sworn to rule, they cease to be
the Lord&#8217;s Anointed any longer; the sanction of their office is
vanished, and they become Tyrants and enemies of mankind, and may be
treated accordingly (p. 412).</p>

<h3>SECTIONS OF DISSENTERS, 1705</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(Ibid., <cite>The Shortest Way to Peace and Union</cite>, p.
456.)</p>

<p>The General body of the Dissenters are composed of four sorts,
and those four so opposite in their tempers, customs, doctrine and
discipline that I am of opinion &#8216;tis as probable all four should
conform to the Church of England as to one another.</p>

<p>There is the Presbyterian, Independent, Anabaptist and Quaker....
The Independent could never bear Presbyterian Government, that has been
tried already; for they once pulled it down by the ears as intolerable.
The Anabaptists in general, declare the Presbyterian would set up
persecution from the old principle, that Presbyteries are &#8220;Jure
divino&#8221; and therefore to them, a Presbyterian Government would be
all one with Popery. The Presbyterian would never brook an Independent
or Anabaptist Government, because they count the one Sectary, and
hardly admit the other to be Orthodox Christians. None of the three
would bear the thought of a Quaker King, the Novelty would make mankind
laugh at the proposal; the splendour and magnificence of a Court, and
the necessary defence and offence which the Confederacies and interests
of nations require, are things so inconsistent with this plain dealing
Professor, that he must cease to be a Quaker when he began to be a
King.</p>

<h3>EIGHTEENTH CENTURY HOME INDUSTRIES</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(D. Defoe, <cite>Tour through Great Britain: Yorkshire</cite>,
Vol. III, p. 124)</p>

<h4>YORKSHIRE. LEEDS CLOTH MARKET.</h4>

<p>Leeds ... is a large, wealthy and populous town, standing on
the north side of the river Aire, with great suburbs on the south
side, and both joined by a stately stone bridge, so large<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span> and
wide, that formerly the cloth-market was kept upon it, and therefore
the refreshment given the clothiers by the inn-keepers (being a pot of
ale, a noggin of pottage, and a trencher of boiled or roast beef, for
two pence) [was] called the <i>Brigg-shot</i> for a long time, though now
disused.</p>

<p>... The trade soon made the Market too great to be confined to the
<i>Brigg</i>; so that it was removed to the High Street ... this bridge
was fallen into decay ... and by the narrowness of the road over,
occasioned by the buildings and other encroachments, made or set up
at both ends and abutments of the bridge, the way or passage over the
same was greatly confined and obstructed, and became ... dangerous to
passengers on foot and horseback....</p>

<p>But the Cloth market held in the Cloth-hall at Leeds is ... perhaps
not to be equalled in the world....</p>

<p>The Clothiers come early in the morning with their cloth ... at
about six o&#8217;clock in the summer, and about seven in the winter,
the Clothiers being all come by that time, the Market Bell at the Old
Chapel by the bridge rings; upon which it would surprise a stranger, to
see in how few minutes, without hurry, noise or the least disorder, the
whole market is filled, all the benches covered with cloth, as close to
one another as the pieces can lie longways, each proprietor standing
behind his own piece, who form a mercantile regiment, as it were, drawn
up in a double line, in as great order as a military one.</p>

<p>As soon as the bell has ceased ringing, the factors and buyers of
all sorts, enter the hall, and walk up and down between the rows, as
their occasions direct. Most of them have papers with patterns sealed
on them, in their hands; the colours of which they match, by holding
them to the cloths they think they agree to. When they have pitched
upon their cloth, they lean over to the clothier, and, by a whisper, in
the fewest words imaginable, the price is stated; one asks, the other
bids; and they agree or disagree in a moment.</p>

<p>The reason of this prudent silence is owing to the clothiers
standing so near to one another; for it is not reasonable that one
trader should know another&#8217;s traffic.... The buyers<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
generally walk up and down twice on each side of the rows, and in
little more than an hour all the business is done. In less than half
an hour you will perceive the cloth begins to move off, the clothier
taking it up upon his shoulder to carry it to the merchant&#8217;s
house. At about half an hour after eight the Market Bell rings again,
upon which the buyers immediately disappear, and the cloth which
remains unsold is carried back to the inn.</p>

<p>Thus you see 10 or 20,000<i>l.</i> worth of cloth, and sometime much
more, bought and sold in little more than an hour, the laws of the
Market being the most strictly observed that I ever saw in any market
in England.</p>

<p>If it be asked, how all these goods, at this place, at Wakefield and
at Halifax are vended and disposed of? I would observe,</p>

<p>First, that there is an Home-consumption; to supply which several
considerable traders in Leeds used to go with droves of pack horses
loaden with those goods, to all the Fairs and Market-towns almost over
the whole island, not to sell by retail, but to the shops by wholesale,
giving large credit. It was ordinary for one of these men to carry a
thousand pounds worth of cloth with him at a time; and, having sold
that, to send his horses back for as much more, and this very often in
a summer. But of late they only travel for orders, and afterwards send
the goods, by the common carriers, to the different places intended.
For they travel chiefly at that season, because of the badness of the
roads.</p>

<p>There are others who have commissions from London to buy, or who
give commissions to factors and warehouse-keepers in London to sell
for them who not only supply all the shop-keepers and wholesale men
in London, but sell also very great quantities to the merchants, as
well for exportation to the English Colonies in America, which take
off great quantities of the coarse goods, especially New England,
New York, Virginia, etc., as also to the Russia merchants, who send
exceeding great quantities to Petersburg, Riga, Dantzie, Narva, Sweden
and Pomerania, though of late the manufacture of this kind set up in
Prussia and other Northern parts of Germany interfere a little with
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158"
id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>The third sort are such as receive commissions directly from abroad,
to buy cloth for the merchants chiefly in Hamburg, Holland, etc.
These are not only many in number, but some of them very considerable
in their dealings, and correspond with the farthest provinces in
Germany....</p>

<p>Another hall is appropriated for the sale of white clothes.... This,
though large, is much inferior to the other.</p>

<h3>THE WEST RIDING, 1724</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(Ibid., pp. 144-6)</p>

<p>... the nearer we came to Halifax, we found the houses thicker, and
the villages greater in every bottom; and not only so, but the sides of
the hills, which were very steep every way, were spread with houses;
for the land being divided into small inclosures, from two acres to six
or seven each, seldom more, every three or four pieces of land had an
house belonging to them.</p>

<p>In short, after we had mounted the third hill we found the country
one continued village, though every way mountainous, hardly an house
standing out of a speaking distance from another; and as the day
cleared up, we could see at every house a tenter, and on almost every
tenter a piece of cloth, kersie or shalloon; which are the three
articles of this country&#8217;s labour.</p>

<p>In the course of our road among the houses, we found at every one of
them a little rill or gutter of running water; if the house was above
the road, it came from it, and crossed the way to run to another; if
the house was below us, it crossed us from some other distant house
above it; and at every considerable house was a manufactory; which not
being able to be carried on without water; these little streams were
so parted and guided by gutters or pipes, that not one of the houses
wanted its necessary appendage of a rivulet.</p>

<p>Again, as the dyeing-houses, scouring-shops, and places where they
use this water, emit it tinged with the drugs of the dyeing-vat, and
with the oil, the soap, the tallow and other ingredients used by the
clothiers in dressing and scouring, etc., the lands through which it
passes, which otherwise would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159"
id="Page_159">[159]</a></span> be exceeding barren are enriched by it
to a degree beyond imagination.</p>

<p>Then as every clothier must necessarily keep one horse, at least to
fetch home his wool and his provisions from the market, to carry his
yarn to the spinners, his manufacture to the fulling-mill, and when
finished to the market to be sold, and the like; so everyone generally
keeps a cow or two for his family. By this means, the small pieces of
inclosed land about each house are occupied; and by being thus fed, are
still farther improved by the dung of the cattle. As for corn, they
scarce grow enough to feed their poultry.</p>

<p>Such, it seems, has been the bounty of nature to this country, that
two things essential to life, and more particularly to the business
followed here, are found in it ... I mean coals, and running water on
the tops of the highest hills ... Nor is the industry of the people
wanting to second these advantages. Though we met few people without
doors, yet within we saw the houses full of lusty fellows, some at
the dye-vat, some at the loom, others dressing the cloths; the women
and children carding or spinning: all employed from the youngest to
the oldest; scarce anything above four years old, but its hands were
sufficient for its own support. Nor a beggar to be seen, nor an idle
person, except here and there in an almshouse, built for those that
are ancient and past working. The people in general live long: they
enjoy a good air; and under such circumstances hard labour is naturally
attended with the blessing of health, if not riches.</p>

<h3>THE COAL TRADE</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(Defoe, <cite>The Complete English Tradesman</cite>, Ed. 1841,
Vol. II, p. 172).</p>

<p>The Newcastle coals, brought by sea to London, are bought at the
pit, or at the steath or wharf, for under five shillings per chaldron;
I suppose I speak with the most; but when they come to London, are
not delivered to the consumers, under from twenty-five to thirty
shillings per chaldron; and when they are a third time loaded on board
the lighters in the Thames, and carried through bridge, then loaded
a fourth time into the great west country barges, and carried<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span> up
the river, perhaps to Oxford or Abingdon, and thence loaded a fifth
time in carts or wagons, and carried perhaps ten or fifteen, or twenty
miles to the last consumer; by this time they are sometimes sold from
forty-five to fifty shillings per chaldron; so that the five shillings
first cost, including five shillings tax, is increased to five times
the prime cost.</p>

<p>And because I have mentioned the frequent loading and unloading the
coals, it is necessary to explain it here once for all, because it may
give a light into the nature of this river and coast commerce, not in
this thing only, but in many others; these loadings are thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(1) They are dug in the pit a vast depth in the ground,
sometimes fifty, sixty to a hundred fathoms; and being
loaded (for so the miners call it) into a great basket or
tub, are drawn up by a wheel and horse, or horses, to the
top of the shaft, or pit mouth, and there thrown out
upon a great heap to lie ready against the ships come into
the port to demand them.</p>

<p>(2) They are then loaded again into a great machine
or wagon; which by the means of an artificial road,
called a wagon-way, goes with the help of but one horse,
and carries two chaldron, or more, at a time and this,
sometimes three or four miles to the nearest river or
water carriage they come at; and there they are either
thrown into, or from a great storehouse, called a steath,
made so artificially, with one part close to, or hanging
over the water, that the lighters or keels can come close
to, or under it, and the coals be at once shot out of the
wagons into the said lighters, which carry them to the
ships, which I call the first loading upon the water.</p></div>

<p class="subhead2">(S. C. Hill, <cite>Bengal in 1756-57</cite>, Vol. III, pp.

<p>The causes of the war were principally three, viz., our acting
unjustifiably by the Moors [Mahommedans]; our<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span> being tricked out of
Cassim bazaar Fort, and the example shown on the coast of Coromandel,
where the English and French have in a great measure, it is said,
divided the country, while their respective Nabobs are no better than
shadows of what they should be.</p>

<p>The injustice to the Moors consists in that being by their courtesy
permitted to live here as merchants, to protect and judge what natives
were their [our?] servants, and to trade custom free, we under that
pretence protected all the Nabob&#8217;s subjects that claimed our
protection, though they were neither our servants nor our merchants,
and gave our <i>dustucks</i> or passes to numbers of natives to trade custom
free, to the great prejudice of the Nabob&#8217;s revenue, nay more,
we levied large duties upon goods brought into our districts from the
very people that permitted us to trade custom free, and by numbers of
their [our?] impositions [framed to raise the Company&#8217;s revenue]
some of which were ruinous to ourselves, such as taxes on marriages,
provisions, transferring land, property, etc., caused eternal clamour
and complaints against us at Court.</p>

<h3>INFLUENCE OF ENGLISH MERCHANTS ON COLONIAL POLICY</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(Callender, <cite>Economic History of the United
States</cite>, p. 140. Franklin, <cite>Causes of American Discontent</cite>, Works, IV,
p. 249)</p>

<p>The colonists being thus greatly alarmed ... by the news of the Act
for abolishing the legislature of New York, and the imposition of these
new duties ... (accompanied by a new set of revenue officers) ... began
seriously to consider their situation....</p>

<p>That the whole American people was forbidden the advantage of a
direct importation of wine, oil and fruit from Portugal but must take
them loaded with all the expense of a voyage, one thousand leagues
about, being to be landed first in England, to be re-shipped for
America, ... and all this, merely that a few Portugal merchants in
London may gain a commission on those goods passing through their
hands.... That on a slight complaint of a few Virginia merchants,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span> nine
colonies had been restrained from making paper money, become absolutely
necessary to their internal commerce, from the constant remittance of
their gold and silver to Britain....</p>

<p>Iron is to be found everywhere in America, and the beaver furs are
the natural produce of that country. Hats and nails and steel are
wanted there as well as here. It is of no importance to the common
welfare of the empire, whether a subject of the King&#8217;s obtains
his living by making hats on this or on that side of the water. Yet
the hatters of England have prevailed to obtain an act in their own
favour, restraining that manufacture in America; in order to oblige
the Americans to send their beaver to England to be manufactured,
and purchase back the hats, loaded with the charges of double
transportation. In the same manner have a few nail-makers, and a still
smaller body of steel-makers (perhaps there are not half a dozen of
these in England) prevailed totally to forbid by an Act of Parliament
the erecting of slitting-mills or steel-furnaces in America; that the
Americans may be obliged to take all their nails for their buildings,
and steel for their tools, from these artificers under the same
disadvantages.</p>

<h3>AMERICAN NON-IMPORTATION POLICY</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(Callender, <cite>Econ. Hist. of U.S.</cite>, pp. 151-54
(summarized). <cite>Journal of the Continental Congress</cite>, 1774, I, p. 75)</p>

<p>We, His Majesty&#8217;s most loyal subjects, the delegates of
the several colonies of New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode
Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, the three
lower counties of New Castle, Kent and Sussex on Delaware, Maryland,
Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina, deputed to represent
them in a continental Congress, held in the city of Philadelphia,
on the 5th day of September, 1774, avowing our allegiance to His
Majesty, our affection and regard for our fellow-subjects in Great
Britain and elsewhere, affected with the deepest anxiety and most
alarming apprehensions, at those grievances and distresses with which
His Majesty&#8217;s American subjects are oppressed; and having taken
under our most serious deliberation the<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span> state of the whole
continent [of America] find, that the present unhappy situation of our
affairs is occasioned by a ruinous system of colony administration
adopted by the British ministry about the year 1763, evidently
calculated for inslaving these colonies, and with them, the British
Empire.... To obtain redress of these grievances ... we are of
opinion, that a non-importation, non-consumption and non-exportation
agreement, faithfully adhered to, will prove the most speedy, effectual
and peaceable measure; and, therefore, we do, for ourselves and the
inhabitants of the several colonies, whom we represent, firmly agree
and associate, under the sacred ties of virtue, honour and love of our
country, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(1) That from and after the first day of December next, we will not
import, into British America, from Great Britain or Ireland, any goods,
wares or merchandise whatsoever, or from any other place, any such
goods, wares or merchandise, as shall have been exported from Great
Britain or Ireland; nor will we, after that day, import any East India
tea from any part of the world; nor any molasses, syrups, paneles,
coffee or pimento, from the British plantations or from Dominica; nor
wines from Madeira or the Western Islands; nor foreign indigo.</p>

<p>(2) We will neither import nor purchase, any slave imported after
the first day of December next, after which time, we will wholly
discontinue the slave trade; and will neither be concerned in it
ourselves, nor will we hire our vessels, nor sell our commodities or
manufactures to those who are concerned in it.</p>

<p>(3) ... we will not purchase or use any tea, imported on account
of the East India Company, or any on which a duty hath been or shall
be paid; and from and after the first day of March next, we will not
purchase or use any East India tea, whatever....</p>

<p>(4) The earnest desire we have, not to injure our fellow subjects
in Great Britain, Ireland or the West Indies, induces us to suspend
a non-exportation, until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164"
id="Page_164">[164]</a></span> the tenth day of September, 1775; at
which time, if the said Acts ... of the British Parliament ... are not
repealed, we will not, directly or indirectly, export any merchandise
or commodity whatsoever, to Great Britain, Ireland or the West Indies,
except rice to Europe....</p>

<p>(11) That a committee be chosen in every county, city, or town ...
to observe the conduct of all persons touching this association....</p>

<p>(12) That the committee of correspondence, in the respective
colonies do frequently inspect the entries of their custom
houses....</p>

<p>(14) ... And we recommend it to the provincial conventions, and to
the committees in the respective colonies, to establish such farther
regulations as they may think proper, for carrying into execution this
association.</p></div>

<h3>A PETITION FOR RECONCILIATION, 1775</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(Callender, <cite>Economic History of U.S.</cite>, pp. 155-57.
Hansard&#8217;s <cite>Parliamentary Debates</cite>, XVIII, p. 168)</p>

<p>Mr. Alderman Hayley said he had a petition from the merchants of the
city of London concerned in the commerce to North America ... setting
forth&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;That the petitioners are all essentially interested in the
trade to North America, either as exporters or importers, or as vendors
of British and foreign goods for exportation to that country; and that
the petitioners have exported, or sold for exportation, to the British
colonies in North America, very large quantities of the manufactures of
Great Britain and Ireland, and in particular, the staple articles of
woollen, iron and linen, also those of cotton, silk, leather, pewter,
tin, copper and brass, with almost every British manufacture; also
large quantities of foreign linens and other articles imported into
these kingdoms, from Flanders, Holland, Germany, the East Countries,
Portugal, Spain and Italy, which are generally received from those
countries in return for British Manufactures; and that the petitioners
have likewise exported, or sold for exportation, great quantities of
the various species of goods imported into this kingdom from<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span> the
East Indies, part of which receive additional manufacture in Great
Britain; and that the petitioners receive returns from North America
to this kingdom directly, viz., pig and bar iron, timber, staves,
naval stores, tobacco, rice, indigo, deer and other skins, beaver and
furs, train oil, whalebone, beeswax, pot and pearl ashes, drugs and
dyeing woods, with some bullion, and also wheat flour, Indian corn and
salted provisions, when, on account of scarcity in Great Britain, those
articles are permitted to be imported;</p>

<p>and that the petitioners receive returns circuitously from Ireland
[for flax seed, etc., exported from North America] by bills of exchange
on the merchants of this city trading to Ireland, for the proceeds of
linens, etc., imported into these kingdoms from the West Indies; in
return for provisions, lumber and cattle, exported from North America
for the use and support of the West India Islands, by bills of exchange
on the West India merchants, for the proceeds of sugar, molasses, rum,
cotton, coffee or other produce, imported from those islands into these
kingdoms; from Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, Flanders, Germany,
Holland and the East Countries by bills of exchange or bullion in
return for wheat flour, rice, Indian corn, fish and lumber, exported
from the British colonies in North America, for the use of those
countries;</p>

<p>and that the petitioners have great reason to believe, from the best
informations they can obtain, that on the balance of this extensive
commerce, there is now due from the colonies in North America, to the
said city only, 2,000,000<i>l.</i> sterling and upwards; and that by the
direct commerce with the colonies, and the circuitous trade thereon
depending, some thousands of ships and vessels are employed, and many
thousands of seamen are bred and maintained, thereby increasing the
naval power and strength of Great Britain;</p>

<p>and that, in the year 1765, there was a great stagnation of the
commerce between Great Britain and her colonies, in consequence of
an Act for granting and applying certain stamp duties, and other
duties, in the British colonies and plantations in America, by
which the merchants trading to North America, and the artificers
employed in the various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166"
id="Page_166">[166]</a></span> manufactures consumed in those
countries, were subjected to many hardships;</p>

<p>and that, in the following year, the said Act was repealed ... upon
which repeal, the trade to the British colonies immediately resumed its
former flourishing state;</p>

<p>and that in the year 1767, an Act passed for granting certain
duties in the British colonies and plantations in America, which
imposed certain duties, to be paid in America, on tea, glass, red and
white lead, painters&#8217; colours, paper, pasteboard, millboard
and scaleboard, when the commerce with the colonies was again
interrupted;</p>

<p>and that in the year 1770, such parts of the said Act as imposed
duties on glass, red and white lead, painters&#8217; colours, paper,
pasteboard, millboard and scaleboard, were repealed, when the trade to
America soon revived, except in the article of tea, on which a duty was
continued, to be demanded on its importation into America, whereby that
branch of our commerce was nearly lost;</p>

<p>and that in the year 1773, an Act passed, to allow a drawback of
the duties of customs on the exportation of tea to His Majesty&#8217;s
colonies or plantations in America, and to empower the Commissioners
of the Treasury to grant licences to the East India Company, to export
tea, duty free;</p>

<p>and by the operation of those and other laws, the minds of His
Majesty&#8217;s subjects in the British colonies have been greatly
disquieted a total stop is now put to the export trade with the
greatest and most important part of North America, the public revenue
is threatened with a large and fatal diminution, the petitioners
with grievous distress, and thousands of industrious artificers and

<p class="noindent">Sir,</p>

<p>The Congress, the better to defend their coasts, protect their
trade, and drive off the enemy, have instructed us to<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
apply to France for eight ships of the line, completely manned, the
expense of which they will undertake to pay. As other princes of Europe
are lending or hiring their troops to Britain against America, it is
apprehended that France may, if she thinks fit, afford our independent
States the same kind of aid, without giving England any just cause
of complaint. But if England should on that account declare war, we
conceive that by the united force of France, Spain and America, she
will lose all her possessions in the West Indies....</p>

<p>We also beg it may be particularly considered, that while the
English are masters of the American seas, and can, without fear of
interruption, transport with such ease their army from one part of our
extensive coast to another, and we can only meet them by land marches,
we may possibly, unless some powerful aid is given us or some strong
diversion be made in our favour, be so harassed and be put to such
immense distress, as that finally our people will find themselves
reduced to the necessity of ending the war by an accommodation....</p>

<h3>EFFECT OF AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE ON EUROPE</h3>

<h4>LETTER FROM FRANKLIN AND DEANE, PARIS, 1777</h4>

<p class="subhead2">(Callender, <cite>Economic History of U.S.</cite>, pp. 174-75.
Wharton, <cite>Revolutionary Diplomatic Correspondence</cite>, II, p. 287)</p>

<p>All Europe is for us. Our Articles of Confederation, being by our
means translated and published here, have given an appearance of
consistence and firmness to the American States and Government that
begins to make them considerable. The separate constitutions of the
several States are also translating and publishing here, which afford
abundance of speculation to the politicians of Europe, and it is a
very general opinion that if we succeed in establishing our liberties,
we shall, as soon as peace is restored, receive an immense<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
addition of numbers and wealth from Europe, by the families who will
come over to participate in our privileges, and bring their estates
with them. Tyranny is so generally established in the rest of the
world, that the prospect of an asylum in America, for those who love
liberty, gives general joy, and our cause is esteemed the cause of all
mankind. Slaves naturally become base, as well as wretched. We are
fighting for the dignity and happiness of human nature. Glorious is it
for the Americans to be called by Providence to this post of honour.
Cursed and detested be everyone that deserts or betrays it.</p>

<h4>POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS RESULTING, 1788</h4>

<p class="subhead2">(Callender, <cite>Economic History of U.S.</cite>, pp. 176-67.
B. de Warville, <cite>The Commerce of America with Europe</cite>, p. 8)</p>

<p>... this war has occasioned discussions important to public
happiness&mdash;the discussion of the social compact&mdash;of civil
liberty, of the means which can render a people independent, of the
circumstances which give sanction to its insurrection, and make it
legal, and which give this people a place among the powers of the
earth.</p>

<p>What good has not resulted from the repeated description of the
English constitution, and of its effects? What good has not resulted
from the codes of Massachusetts and New York, published and spread
everywhere? And what benefits will they still produce? They will
not be wholly taken for a model; but despotism will pay a greater
respect, either from necessity or reason, to the rights of men, which
are so well known and established.... This revolution, favourable to
the people, which is preparing in the cabinets of Europe, will be
undoubtedly accelerated, by that which its commerce will experience,
and which we owe to the enfranchisement of America. The war which
procured it for her, has made known the influence of commerce on power,
the necessity of public credit, and consequently of public virtue,
without which it cannot long subsist....</p>

<p>These are the advantages which France, the world and humanity, owe
to the American Revolution....</p>

<h3>INVENTORS OF MACHINERY</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(Macpherson, <cite>Annals of Commerce</cite>, Vol. IV, p.
77)</p>

<p>In the early part of the 18th century [1748] an engine was invented
by Mr. Paul, with the assistance of some others in London, who, having
obtained a patent [1748], made trial of it at Nottingham and elsewhere,
to the great loss of all concerned. Other schemes for spinning cotton
by machinery have since been tried, and proved equally abortive.</p>

<p>About the year 1767 the discovery of this great desideratum in
mechanics and manufacture was attempted by three different persons.
The first, I believe, was Mr. Hargreaves of Blackburn in Lancashire,
who constructed an engine, capable of spinning 20 or 30 threads of
cotton yarn fit for fustian: but his machinery being destroyed by
popular tumults, he removed to Nottingham.... Mr. Hayes invented a
spinning engine and cylindrical carding engines, but never brought
them to perfection. Mr. Arkwright ... after many experiments, finished
his first engine in the year 1768 ... and in the year 1775, having
brought his original machinery to a greater degree of perfection, and
having also invented machines for preparing the cotton for spinning,
he obtained a fresh patent for his new invention. Hitherto he and
his partners had reaped no profits from the undertaking; but now,
proper buildings being erected at the expense of 30,000l. and the
machinery being made capable of being put in motion by the strength
of cattle, water, steam, or any other regular moving power, it began,
notwithstanding some losses from riots ... to be productive to the
proprietors.</p>

<h3>JAMES&#8217; ACCOUNT OF HARGREAVES</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(Baines, <cite>History of Cotton</cite>, p. 164. Note)</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew Mr. Hargreaves very well: he was a stout, broadset
man, about five feet, ten inches high, or rather more: he first
worked in Nottingham with Mr. Shipley about 1768, and here my father
first met him. He was making jennies for Shipley, who then wished
to go into the cotton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170"
id="Page_170">[170]</a></span> spinning. My Father prevailed on him
to leave Shipley and embark with him in a new concern: and money was
borrowed by my father principally on the mortgage of some freehold
property, on which they were to erect their mill. The mill was erected,
and two dwelling houses, in one of which my father resided and in the
other was Mr. Hargreaves&#8217; family.&#8221;</p>

<h3>ARKWRIGHT OVERRATED</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(Baines, <cite>History of Cotton</cite>, p. 195)</p>

<p>The marvellous and &#8220;unbounded invention&#8221; which he
claimed for himself ... did not belong to Arkwright. It is clear that
some of the improvements which made the carding engine what it was when
he took out his second patent, were devised by others; and there are
two prior claimants to the invention of spinning by rollers before the
patent of Arkwright. [Possibly] the latter derived the principle of his
machine either from Wyatt or Highs ... at the same time it is certain
that Arkwright displayed great inventive talent in perfecting the
details.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Wealth flowed in upon him with a full stream from his skilfully
managed concern. For several years he fixed the price of cotton twist,
all other spinners conforming to his prices.... In 1786 Arkwright was
appointed High Sheriff of Derbyshire ... and [later] received the
honour of knighthood.</p>

<h3>CROMPTON&#8217;S MULE</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(Ibid., p. 199)</p>

<p>&#8220;In regard to the mule, the date of its being first completed
was in the year 1799: at the end of the following year I was under the
necessity of making it public, or destroying it, as it was not in my
power to keep it and work it; and to destroy it was too painful a task,
having been four and a half years at least, wherein every moment of
time and power of mind as well as expense, which my other employment
would permit, were devoted to this one end, the having good yarn to
weave; so that to destroy it, I could not.&#8221;</p>

<h3>THE BANKING-HOUSE OF COUTTS &amp; CO.</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(Sir W. Forbes, <cite>Memoirs of a Banking-House</cite>, Ed.,
Chambers, 1860)</p>

<p>The founder of the Edinburgh house of business ... was Patrick
Coutts, the fourth son of Alexander Coutts, provost of Montrose (p.
1) ... he carried on business in Edinburgh as a merchant at least as
early as the year 1696. The books are kept in Scots money and very
neatly and distinctly written. He appears to have been a general
merchant, whose transactions were considerably extended, for in his
books there are accounts of mercantile adventures to New York and
Pennsylvania, to Amsterdam, to France and to the Canaries.... He left
three sons, John, James and Christian ... (John) engaged in mercantile
concerns in Edinburgh in the year 1723.... Their business was dealing
in corn, buying and selling goods on commissions, and the negotiation
of bills of exchange in London, Holland, France, Italy, Spain and
Portugal. The negotiation of bills of exchange formed at that period
a considerable part of the business of Edinburgh; for there were then
no country banks.... I see many notices of the difficulty, at that
time, of effecting money transactions of any considerable extent in
the country towns of Scotland.... A mercantile business was likewise
formed about this time (1750) in London, by the Messrs. Coutts ... as
the correspondents of the house in Edinburgh (p. 6).... In England
the house had large quantities of corn shipped for them at Yarne
and at Stockton in Yorkshire; at Lyme Regis, Fakenham and Yarmouth,
all in the rich corn county of Norfolk; at Haverfordwest in South
Wales, and by the noted Cooper Thornhill, who at that time kept the
Bell inn at Hilton, was one of the most considerable corn factors in
England.... Indeed, I have often thought it not a little singular
that a banking-house ... should have chosen to embark so largely
in the corn-trade, which is, perhaps, that most liable to sudden
fluctuation.... Yet in this the Messrs. Coutts were not singular....</p>

<p>The other principal banking-houses in Edinburgh at that time
were Messrs. Mansfield &amp; Co., William Cuming, William<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span> Hogg
and Son, and William Alexander &amp; Sons. The two first confined
themselves strictly to the banking-business, in which they rose to
great eminence from a very obscure origin. From a slender start in
life, as a draper, old Mr. James Mansfield began to deal a little in
bills of exchange, and by degrees founded a banking-house of the first
celebrity in Scotland. In the same manner William Cuming succeeded to
his father, old Patrick Cuming&#8217;s cloth-shops in the Parliament
Close, which he afterwards converted into a counting-house where
he confined himself entirely to the transacting of money business
and after a long life left a very large fortune. William Hogg &amp;
Son were not in very extensive business and they managed it very
confusedly. William Alexander &amp; Sons were very considerable
money-dealers, though their chief employment was purchasing tobacco for
the Farmers-general of France (p. 9).</p>

<p class="p2">&#8220;John Coutts, the second son (of the late Lord
Provost Coutts) under whose eye chiefly I served my apprenticeship, was
one of the most agreeable men I ever knew. Lively and wellbred, and of
very engaging manners, he had the happy talent of uniting a love of
society and public amusements with a strict attention to business....
Having received his mercantile education in Holland, he had all the
accuracy and all the strictness of a Dutchman; and, to his lessons it
is that I owe any knowledge I possess of the principles of business, as
well as an attachment to <em>form</em> which I shall probably carry with me to
the grave....</p>

<p class="p2">So strict was he in the discipline of the counting-house,
that I slept but one night out of Edinburgh from the commencement of my
apprenticeship in May 1754, till the month of September, 1760, when I
obtained leave to go to Aberdeenshire with my mother to pay a visit to
our relations&#8221; (p. 10).</p>

<p>... Our new copartnery commenced ... the Seven Years&#8217; War
had just been terminated.... The rate of exchange for bills on
London was as high as three, four and even five per cent. against
Scotland. This, of necessity, occasioned demands on the bank at
Edinburgh for specie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173"
id="Page_173">[173]</a></span> which they were unable or unwilling
to answer.... In London the character and credit of Scottish paper
was at the lowest ebb, and the Bank of England was extremely shy of
discounting bills drawn on London from Edinburgh. It was therefore a
task of no ordinary difficulty to conduct the affairs of our two houses
with safety (p. 19).... Very soon after (1771) two important events
took place, extremely memorable in the history of the house. I mean
the commission from the Farmers-general of France for the purchase
of tobaccos in Scotland; and the erecting of the Banking Co., in St.
James&#8217; Street, London. The great company in France, known by
the name of the Farmers-general, from their having farmed the public
taxes of that kingdom under the old government, enjoyed by consequence
the exclusive privilege of importing tobacco into France, with which
they were chiefly supplied from Scotland, the article being originally
procured by the merchants of Glasgow from North America (p. 27).</p>

<h3>ROMAN ROADS IN YORKSHIRE</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(D. Defoe, <cite>Tour through Great Britain</cite>, p. 123)</p>

<p>From Ferrybridge, within a mile of Pontefract, extends a large stone
Causeway, about a mile in length, to a village called Brotherton. A
little to the south of this village, the great Road divides into two
parts; one goes on to the right to York, and the other through Aberford
and Watherley to Scotland.... This Causeway in many places is entirely
perfect, although undoubtedly a work of 16 or 1700 years old, and
in other places where it is broken up, the courses appear to be of
different materials; the bottom is clay or earth, upon that is chalk,
then gravel, upon the gravel is stone, and then gravel upon that....
This Causeway runs in a direct line from Doncaster to Castleford,
where it makes an angle and runs in another direct line to Aberford,
Tadcaster and York. It is very easy to trace its course over moors and
open grounds which have not been cultivated; but there are few or no
remains upon the enclosed lands. There is no doubt but that the Romans
had communications between all their stations in this country, by roads
of this kind.</p>

<h3>THE ROMAN WALL</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(A. Young, <cite>Northern Tour</cite>, Letter XVI, p. 112)</p>

<p>From Glenwelt I walked about half a mile to view some of the
remnants of the famous Roman wall, a piece above five feet high and
several yards long; the facing is of regularly cut freestone but I
measured none of them above thirteen inches long and seven broad; the
mortar in the facing is quite gone, but much of it remains in the
middle, the filling up; very little of it is of that hard nature often
found in ancient buildings, but crumbles with ease between the fingers.
The stones of the facing are cut very regularly, and well laid; the
workmanship undoubtedly very good. Not far from this wall the remains
of an earth entrenchment, thrown up for the same purpose, are seen in a
parallel line with it.</p>

<h3>LANCASTER</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(Ibid., Letter XVIII, p. 196)</p>

<p>Lancaster is a flourishing town, well situated for trade, of which
it carries on a pretty brisk one; possessing about 100 sail of ships,
some of them good burthen, for the African and American trades. The
only manufactory in the town is that of cabinet ware. Here are many
cabinet makers who work up the mahogany brought home in their own
ships, and re-export it to the West Indies, etc.</p>

<h3>MARLING</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(Ibid., Letter XVIII, p. 198)</p>

<p>As to manures, marle is the grand one, which is found under
all this country (Lancashire) and generally within sixteen or
twenty inches of the surface ... it lies in beds, many of them
of a vast depth, the bottoms of some pits not being found. It is
white, and as soft and soapy as butter. They lay about a hundred
two-horse cartloads to an acre, but some farmers less, on to lays<a
name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31"
class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and stubble. It lasts a good improvement
for twenty years: costs about &pound;4 10s. 0d. an acre.<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span> Marle
is their principal manure, both white, black, blue, sandy and some
small marle. They sometimes find perfect cockle and periwinkle shells
nine yards deep in beds of marle. It does best on light soil.</p>

<h3>MANCHESTER</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(Ibid., Letter XVIII, pp. 242, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">et seq.</i>)</p>

<p>The Manchester manufacturers are divided into four
branches&mdash;the fustian, the check, the hat and the worsted small
wares. All sorts of cotton are used but chiefly the West Indian....
Many low priced goods they make for N. America, and many fine ones for
the West Indies. The whole business was exceedingly brisk during the
(7 Years&#8217;) war, and very bad after the peace, but now are pretty
good again, though not equal to what they were during the war. All
the revolutions of late in the N. American affairs are felt severely
in this branch ... the interruptions caused by the convulsions in
America very severely felt by every workman. None ever offered for work
but they at once had it, except upon the regulations of the Colonies
cutting off their trade with the Spaniards, and the Stamp Act. The last
advices received from America have had a similar effect, for many hands
were paid off in consequence of them ... America takes three-fourths of
all the manufacturers of Manchester.</p>

<h3>NEWCASTLE</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(Ibid., Letter XV, p. 11. 1770)</p>

<p>This town is supposed to contain 40,000 souls, and to employ of its
own 500 sail of ships, 400 of which are colliers. The people employed
in the coal mines are prodigiously numerous amounting to many thousand;
the earnings of the men are from 1/-to 4/-a day and their firing.</p>

<p>About five miles from Newcastle are the ironworks, late
Crawley&#8217;s, supposed to be the greatest manufactory of the
kind in Europe. Several hundred hands are employed in it, insomuch
that &pound;20,000 a year is paid in wages. They earn<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span> from
1/-to 2/6 a day, and some of the foremen as much as &pound;200 a year.
The quantity of iron they work up is very great, employing three ships
to the Baltic that each make ten voyages yearly and bring 70 tons at a
time.... They use a good deal of American iron which is as good as any
Swedish and for some purposes much better. They would use more of it if
larger quantities were to be had, but they cannot get it&mdash;which is
worthy of remark.</p>

<p>In general their greatest work is for exportation and are
employed very considerably by the East India Company: they have
of late had a prodigious artillery demand from that Company<a
name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32"
class="fnanchor">[32]</a>.</p>

<p>As to the machines for accelerating several operations in the
manufacture, copper rollers ... and the scissors for cutting bars of
iron ... the turning cranes ... the beating hammer. There are machines
of manifest utility, simple in their construction and all moved by
water ... there are no impossibilities in mechanics, an anchor of 20
tons may undoubtedly be managed with as much ease as a pin.</p>

<h3>AMERICAN TRADE</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(Macpherson, <cite>Annals of Commerce</cite>, IV, p. 10)</p>

<p>The Consequences resulting to Great Britain from the independence of
the American States, may, with great truth, be called <em>advantages</em>....
A great and obvious advantage was the relief from governing and
protecting them ... relief from the payment of bounties ... the
recovery of the valuable trade of shipbuilding ... sacrificed to the
zeal for promoting the prosperity of the Colonies.</p>

<p>It was said ... that Great Britain possessed the whole of the
American trade before the revolt.... It is well known that before the
war the Americans carried a considerable proportion of their trade
to other nations, contrary to law. Now they are at liberty to deal
with other nations or with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177"
id="Page_177">[177]</a></span> Britain; and for that reason alone some
of them will choose to deal with Britain.... Experience has fully shown
that there was no real cause to apprehend any decay of the British
commerce in consequence of the new order of things in America: and
moreover, what must effectually silence all controversy on the subject,
the official accounts of the Custom House demonstrate that there has
been a greater and more rapid increase in the general commerce of Great
Britain, and especially of the commerce with America, since the era of
American independence than ever there was.</p>

<h3>EIGHTEENTH CENTURY ENCLOSURES</h3>

<p class="subhead2">(A. Young, <cite>Northern Tour</cite>, Letter IV, pp.
252-65)</p>

<p>There is scarcely any point in rural economics more generally
acknowledged than the great benefits of enclosing open lands ... some
... it is true ... assert them to be very mischevious to the poor.</p>

<p>First: The proprietors of large estates generally agree upon the
measure ... the small proprietor, whose property in the township is
perhaps his all, has little or no weight ... and as little weight in
the choice of commissioners.</p>

<p>Third: The attorney delivers his bill to the commissioners, who pay
him and themselves without producing any account, and in what manner
they please ... the expenses previous to the actual inclosing are from
&pound;1800 to &pound;2000 all which is levied and expended by the
commissioners absolutely and without control.</p>

<p>Fourth: The division and distribution of the lands are totally in
their breasts.... Nor is there any appeal but to the commissioners
themselves from their allotments, however carelessly or partially made.
Thus is the property of the proprietors, and especially the small ones,
entirely at their mercy.</p>

<p>I am not here arguing against inclosures, the advantages arising
from them are certainly very extensive. I am only saying they do not
always indemnify the <em>present</em> possessor from the great expense he is
at in obtaining them, by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178"
id="Page_178">[178]</a></span> absurd and extravagant manner in which
they are generally conducted.</p>

<p>I do not think there is much reason to find fault with any of these
average prices as exorbitant or higher than a flourishing agriculture
can well afford to pay, nor are any of them so low as to oppress the
labouring poor; there not being above one or two places where any
allowance is made for <em>piece work</em>, whereas much is everywhere done;
and it is universally known that they earn more in that manner than the
weekly pay of the country.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Servants&#8217; wages are higher than I conceived. &pound;10 8s.
6d. for upper farming men is out of proportion to the average pay of
labourers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The rates of labour admit of prodigious variations.... I apprehend
that Chance has been the mother of three fourths. Famine before the
exportation of corn was encouraged, and extreme high prices locally
heightened the prices of labour, as the richer inhabitants were more
or less willing to assist the poor. The rates so raised in some places
continued after the occasion, in others were reduced.</p>

<p>Poor rates are never nicely proportioned to the prices of provisions
and the necessities of the poor, but depend on the temper of
individuals, the caprice of parish officers and justices of the peace.
They are as often raised by clamour as by real necessity.</p>

Commons, 1816:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Having other pursuits, it was not often in my power to visit
the factories, but whenever such visits were made I was struck with the
uniform appearance of bad health, and, in many cases, stunted growth of
the children. The hours of labour were regulated by the interests of
the overseer, whose remuneration was regulated by the quantity of work
done&#8221; (p. 9).</p></div>

<p class="p1"><i>Evidence of John Moss</i>, overseer of Blackbarrow Mill, near Preston
(summarized):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The children in the mill were almost all apprentices from London
parishes. They were worked from five in the morning to eight at night
all the year round, with only one hour for the two meals; in making up
lost time they frequently worked from five in the morning till ten at
night, and invariably they worked from six on the Sunday morning till
twelve, in cleaning the machinery for the week!</p></div>

<p>&#8220;These children were often sent one, two, or three hundred
miles from their place of birth, separated for life from all relations.
It had been known that with a bankrupt&#8217;s effect a gang ... of
these children had been put up to sale and were advertised publicly as
a part of the property ... a number of these boys, apprenticed by a
parish in London to one manufacturer, had been transferred to another,
and had been found by some benevolent persons in a state of absolute
famine.... Not many years ago an agreement had been made between a
London parish and a Lancashire manufacturer ... that with every twenty
sound children, one idiot should be taken!&#8221; (p. 11).</p></div>

<cite>Evidence of a Spinner.</cite></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;I find it difficult to keep my <em>piecers</em> awake the last hours
of a winter evening; have seen them fall asleep and go on performing
their work with their hands while they were asleep, after the <i>billey</i>
had stopped. When their work was over, I have stopped and looked at
them for two minutes, going through the motions of <i>piecening</i> when
they were fast asleep, when there was no work to do, and they were
doing nothing; children at night are so fatigued that they are asleep
often as soon as they sit down, so that it is impossible to wake them
to sense enough to wash themselves, or even to eat a bit of supper,
being so stupid in sleep&#8221; (p. 19).</p></div>

have so swelled legs, one in particular, from standing so long, about
17 years old, that she can hardly walk; that various of them have
their feet bent in and their legs crooked from the same cause (p.

<h3 class="pg">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
